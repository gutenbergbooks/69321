<p class='c008'>These Studies in the history of Old London were written at
the request of Students of Charing Cross Hospital, and were first
published in their Gazette. The rough outlines, marks of which
may be easily discerned, were formed by the notes for Lectures
delivered to the Students and Nursing Staff of the Hospital on
various occasions. It is hoped that in the present form these
Studies may continue to be of interest to friends of Charing Cross
Hospital, and perhaps also to the large and increasing number of
Students of the history of London.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>The</span> fact that the conventual Hospital of St. Mary Roncevall was
founded at the village of Charing in the time of Henry III, and that
it continued to exist till the dissolution of the religious houses by
Henry VIII, is well known to students of the history of London; but,
so far as the writer is aware, no definite attempt had been made to
collect the remaining records of this interesting medical foundation
before 1907, when the story of the Convent and its Hospital was
published privately.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Nevertheless, the influence of the Convent and
the Hospital which it established was considerable during the three
centuries of their existence in England. The name which the Convent
in London received from the Mother House served to revive the
memories of perilous journeys and of timely succour in the minds of
many who had travelled abroad in France and Spain engaged either
in warlike or peaceful affairs, the name of Roncevall in many forms
came to be used as a family designation in various parts of England;<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
and Chaucer refers to the existence of the Convent in a way that shows
that the reference required no explanation to his readers. After the
dissolution of the alien priories the fraternity owed its continued
existence to the recognition of the charitable assistance it rendered
to “the poor people flocking to the Hospital.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>This attempt to fill up a gap in the history of London hospitals
may be of some service to the students of the history of medicine, and
of interest to the larger number who are unwilling to forget the stories
of Old London.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Roncesvalles.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>There are few places so renowned in the early literature of the
Romance languages as the pass through the Western Pyrenees, at
the southern extremity of which lies the village of Roncesvalles. The
Song of Roland handed down the memories of Roncesvalles from the
early Middle Ages; but this famous poem (dating in its present form
from the latter part of the eleventh century) must be regarded only
as the final and successful effort to collect the traditions which form
the foundations of French and Spanish history. The traditions find
their earliest record in the legends and “chansons de geste,” which,
in the first instance, served to commemorate the successful rising
of the people of Spain to expel an invader, Charlemagne, the
Emperor of the North. The rearguard of his retreating host, consisting
chiefly of Frankish subjects of the Emperor under the leadership
of the Count Roland, Captain-General of the Breton March, the
Emperor’s nephew, was overwhelmed and annihilated, while traversing
the Pass on their retreat from Spain in the year 778. The ancient
history of Eginhard, telling of the Spaniards, says very suggestively
“usque ad unum omnes interficiunt ac ... summa cum celeritate in
diversa disperguntur.” Even “li gentilz quens” did not escape the
massacre. The Chanson de Roland gives the French version of this
tradition, which was accepted by the Normans in England; the Spanish
legend of the hero Bernardo del Carpio gives, as it is to be expected,
a very different account of the overthrow of the Emperor.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the course of the succeeding centuries the Pass of Roncesvalles
occupies on more than one occasion a prominent place in British
history. One of the most picturesque passages in Froissart tells how
the army of Edward the Black Prince traversed the Pass in the ill-omened
invasion of Spain that led to his fatal illness. His remarkable
victory at Navarrete scarcely relieves the gloomy record of this adventure.
Little more than one hundred years have elapsed since Roncesvalles
and the neighbouring defiles once more saw the advance of
war-worn British soldiery. In the defence of these passes against
the advance of the French under Soult, so nearly successful in overwhelming
Wellington’s right flank, and in the subsequent pursuit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the retreating French armies, some of the most remarkable of the feats
of arms which distinguished the Peninsular War took place. British
military history contains few more stirring episodes than the combats
between the French and the allied troops in the Passes of Maya and
Roncesvalles.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The memories of Roncesvalles, therefore, are in no danger of being
forgotten, but it has passed from knowledge that for a period of more
than three hundred years the name of Roncesvalles was more familiar
to the citizens of Westminster and London than to the dwellers
in Pamplona and Bayonne. How it came about that an important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>religious house dedicated to Our Lady of Roncesvalles should have been
established at Charing will best be understood if we consider the
nature of the activities of the ancient Monastery in the Pass of
Roncesvalles, the numbers of those on whom it conferred benefits, and
the character of its benefactors in England.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Convent of St. Mary Roncesvalles in Navarre.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>From very early Christian times a religious house, no doubt very
small in its beginnings, was situated near the top of the pass through
which runs the ancient road over the Pyrenees leading from Pamplona
in Navarre, through the mountains by St. Jean Pied-de-Port, to
Bayonne and Bordeaux. The religious community at this place
received its most important support from Charlemagne himself, when
he established a religious house intended to be a memorial of Roland
and his comrades in arms. The original Convent of Charlemagne’s
foundation was situated close to the village of Ibañeta, near the summit
of the Pass and the site of the great battle. Of this house only insignificant
and deserted ruins remain. After a destructive raid by the
Moors under Abderramen, Caliph of Cordova, in 921, the community
removed to the present site of the Monastery in the village of Roncesvalles,
two or three kilometres farther south. The removal of the
Convent to this site is said to have been determined by various
miraculous signs, among others by the discovery of an image of the
Holy Virgin, and it was clearly to the advantage of the community
that its permanent settlement should be in the comparatively sheltered
southern approaches of the Pass rather than on the exposed summit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Order of Roncesvalles thus became established on a firmer
basis, and at first had distinct military as well as religious purposes.
The members of the community consisted of knights and companions,
as well as the brothers and sisters, who all bore the badge of the Order.
The duties which they had to fulfil were military, for the Knights of
Roncesvalles were in frequent conflict with the Moors, and religious,
for not only did the brethren serve their Church, but one of the earliest
and most important duties of the community was to establish a hospital
in the Pass for wayfarers in this wild region.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the course of time the members of this military-religious community
received the Augustinian Rule, but they retained much of their
independence, the memories of their original order, and especially held
to the traditions of hospitality and charitable succour to pilgrims and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to those in distress. The Convent and its Hospital gradually acquired
wide renown on account of the good works carried on by the Canons.
Their house was on the main road between France and Spain.
The military expeditions so frequently traversing the frontiers
marched along the highway passing its doors, pilgrims visiting the
shrine of St. James at Compostella must have halted there on their
way to and from the south, and the road through the Pass was the
chief highway for peaceful travellers of every kind. The community,
therefore, increased in importance and in wealth by gifts from princes,
nobles, knights, and the common folk, and came to possess property
not only in Spain, but also in Portugal, Italy and in France, and, as
the records show, in England and Wales, in Ireland, and in Scotland.
It is stated that at the height of its prosperity the Convent distributed
annually from 25,000 to 30,000 rations, each consisting of a loaf of
16 oz., half a pint of wine, with sufficient soup and meat, or fish on
days of fast. Those who were infirm had chicken broth and mutton.
The Hospital had a staff consisting of the physicians, with whom were
associated surgeons and an apothecary, and one of the distinguishing
features of the Order at a very early period was that it included sisters.
In the case of patients dying while in hospital, free interment was given
after the celebration of masses in due form. It is expressly stated that
the daughter house in England, with its possessions in that country, in
Ireland, and in Scotland, remitted annually the sum of 4,000 ducats
for the support of the Mother House at Roncesvalles.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the community of
Roncesvalles fell on evil days. The march of events deprived them of
their property abroad, while laxity in the observance of their Rule
and the continually disturbed state of the Franco-Spanish frontier
brought about the loss of the greater part of their accumulated possessions
and wealth. Unfortunately the ancient records of the Monastery
have nearly all been destroyed; but there remains in the library an
unpublished manuscript giving the history of the Order and the Convent,
written by Don Juan Huarte, about the middle of the seventeenth
century, which incorporates information received from a certain Don
Francisco Olastro<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> (who is stated to have been an ambassador from

<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>statements it contains appear to have acquired the characteristics of
tradition and can be accepted only after careful collation and criticism.
We have, therefore, to depend almost entirely on the English records
for the history of the House of Roncesvalles in London.</p>

<p class='c018'>To understand how it was possible that a religious house in the
Pyrenees could hold possessions scattered throughout so many different
lands, it must be clearly borne in mind that in the Middle Ages the
rule exercised by the Church took very little cognizance of State limits.
The ecclesiastical power was much stronger than the national influences
of the time, and the Church drew its revenues from all Christian
countries, quite irrespective of political boundaries. At the time when
the House of Roncesvalles at Charing was founded, the overlordship
of the Pope had been felt in England and in France in a very real
manner. In addition to this ecclesiastical bond, the political relationships
between England, France and Northern Spain were of the most
intimate character, so that the all-pervading power of the Church
could be exercised with the greater ease in these countries. During the
period of the Norman, and even more so during the Angevin dynasty,
the English barons experienced the greatest difficulty in detaching
themselves from the influences exerted on them by their foreign
relationships, even if they had the desire to do so. In many cases they
seem to have frankly regarded their insular possessions as sources
of revenue and power to be made use of in order to promote their
Continental interests. In this respect they followed the example
set in such unmistakable fashion by kings such as Richard and John.
The Church acted in the same manner, and many foreign convents
were able, by their powerful influence, to obtain possession of, and
to exploit, the rich lands of England for their own support. It
was not until the close of the reign of John and during the reign
of Henry III that the separate destinies of England and France
became apparent to the more sagacious of the English statesmen
of that period. It is very instructive, therefore, to note as evidence
of the complicated and distracting political and social influences still
felt by the English magnates, that the noble family which perhaps most
of all by its example and advice sought to uphold the political independence
of England as apart from France, was nevertheless impelled
to become one of the great benefactors of a foreign religious house.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>William Marshall, Earl of Pembroke (1219-31), Founder of St. Mary Roncevall.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The House of Roncesvalles appears to have owed most of its
property in England and in Ireland to the liberality of William
Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, the eldest son of the great William
Marshall—<i>Rector regis et regni</i>—the Protector of the King and his
kingdom after the death of John. The elder Marshall stands out in
conspicuous fashion as the most steadfast of all the advisers of the
king during the dark period coinciding with the reigns of Richard I
and John. His early years were passed in France, acquiring skill in
the martial exercises commonly practised by the young nobles of the
day, and his courage and proficiency in arms were such that he had
early acquired the reputation of being one of the most redoubtable
knights in Christendom. If no other evidence remained of his prowess,
the historic passage of arms against Richard Cœur de Lion while still
Count of Poitiers will be sufficient proof.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> On this occasion he overthrew
Richard and held him at his mercy, preventing the mad attack
on his father, and probably saved the Prince from the fate of being
a parricide. In addition to his skill in the use of arms, he gradually
built up for himself a reputation for prudence, sagacity and
loyalty, so that while still a young man he was entrusted with the
guardianship of the young Henry, son of Henry II, and in the
succeeding reigns occupied the most prominent positions under the
English Crown, trusted by the barons and even by John. The
testimony of the French King Philip Augustus, when informed of the
death of William Marshall, as to his reputation for loyalty and honour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>remains on record: “Et, en vérité le Maréchal fut l’homme le plus
loyal que j’aie jamais connu.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>During the many years of William Marshall’s residence abroad
he travelled widely throughout France and no doubt in Northern
Spain. It is well known that he went on pilgrimage to the Holy
Sepulchre in fulfilment of a promise given to the young Henry on his
deathbed. Marshall must have been very familiar with the reputation
of the Monastery at Roncesvalles. There can be little doubt that he
had passed it on his journeyings; the military-religious character of
its Rule would have appealed to him, and he may even have rested in
the House of the Convent. His piety is evidenced by the fact that he
became closely associated with the Order of the Knights Templars,
was one of their great benefactors in England, and at his death received
sepulture in their church, then newly built in London.</p>

<p class='c008'>The elder Marshall died in the year 1219, and was succeeded by
his eldest son, also called William, who then became possessed of one
of the most extensive heritages in England, for the English and
Welsh lands of the Clares, Earls of Pembroke, and in addition their
great Irish inheritance in Leinster, had come into the possession of
the Marshall family.</p>

<p class='c008'>What we know of the son shows him to have been a man of
much the same type as his father—probably not so rugged, but with
the same steadfast ideals of loyal conduct. It is evident that his
character was as strongly tinctured with religious feeling as was that
of his father. He also was an Associate of the Order of the Knights
Templars, and was one of their principal supporters after their
removal to the “New Temple,” where the “Temple” Church still
stands. His admiration for his father is clearly shown by the priceless
biography of the elder William which we still possess. This
poem is known as “L’Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal” and is
evidently the work of a professional writer of the period, but it
was composed under the direction of the son of the great Marshall
with the assistance of Jean d’Erleé,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> his father’s old companion and
faithful squire.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>During the lifetime of William Marshall and his son, and for long
before and after, the high road through the Pass of Roncesvalles
was much frequented. It was the main line of communication by
land between France and Spain on the western frontier, and was
used both by peaceful travellers and by the numerous military
expeditions passing from one country to the other. These expeditions
resulted not only from the constant warfare of the border but
were also organized by Crusaders on their way to help the Spaniard
against the Moor, frequently with the purpose of travelling farther to
the Holy Land. At this time also the relationships formed by
Henry II and his sons with the Courts of the new kingdoms in
the north of Spain, which were beginning to arise as the tide of
Moorish invasion receded, were of the most intimate character. It will
be remembered that Richard, when King of England, married Berengaria,
daughter of Sancho VI of Navarre, after a very troublesome
wooing, and that the younger Sancho took the part of Richard while
the latter was on crusade against their common enemies in the South
of France. The relationship between the Courts of Aragon and Castile
and the Angevin Kings was no less intimate. William Marshall and
his eldest son were in the closest association with the Royal House.
They both travelled far and wide over France and Northern Spain,
so that the Angevin dominions in Aquitaine and the neighbouring
kingdom of Navarre must at one time have been as well known to
the Marshall family as their home in England.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another reason which brought many travellers along the road
through Roncesvalles was the attraction of the Shrine of St. James
at Compostella. The pilgrimage to Compostella was undertaken by
knights and their squires as the result of vows made on the field
of battle, and was famed for its efficacy among all engaged in military
affairs. But the pilgrimage even to armed bands was a dangerous one
on account of the disturbed state of the frontier. An interesting
example of this is presented in the relationships between Richard
and his neighbour the Count of Toulouse. The ostensible cause for
Richard’s warfare against the Count of Toulouse was the inveterate
inclination of the latter to acts of brigandage. When war was declared
the Count of Toulouse had actually captured and ill-treated two English
knights named Robert le Poer and Ralph Fraser, on their return
from a pilgrimage to Compostella. The reputation of the Hospital
of St. Mary in the Pass of Roncesvalles and of the Convent which
supported the Hospital was known to every traveller—peaceful or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>warlike—in Western Europe, and would certainly have appealed to
the benevolence of such a man as the younger William Marshall.
The probability is that both father and son had stronger motives
for giving alms to the Community—the result of benefits received
from the Convent and Hospital during their journeys between France
and Spain.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Coming of the Brethren to England (1229) and the Foundation of the Convent at Charing</span>.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The first knowledge we have of the presence in England of members
of the Community of Roncesvalles is obtained from the letters of protection
given to certain brethren by Henry III, in the year 1229.
These letters were of the usual complete character, and it is clear that
the intention of the deputation from Roncesvalles was to seek alms in
England for the support of their House in the remote valley in the
Pyrenees. This purpose was definitely encouraged by a special clause
in the letters of protection.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brethren seem to have been taken under the patronage of the
younger William Marshall from the beginning. They may even have
come to England on his invitation, for we find that he soon commenced
to make arrangements to give them revenues and an establishment in
this country. Very unfortunately for the Convent, the Earl died in the
year 1231, soon after his return to England from Henry’s disastrous
campaign in Poitou and Brittany, where he had held the chief command.
But the record of his great gift remains, for on August 11, 1232, Henry
confirmed at Wenlock “the grant to Saint Mary and the Hospital at
Roncevaux (<i>Roscida Vallis</i>) of the gift which William Marshall,
sometime Earl of Pembroke, made to them of all his houses at Cherring,
and the houses and curtilages adjoining them formerly belonging to
William Briwere, and of 100<i>s.</i> at Suthanton payable from the
houses of the said Earl there, of 13<i>l.</i> of land in Netherwent in
the moor of Magor, and of a carucate of land in Assandon, which he
bought from Robert de Rochford.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was thus in consequence of the munificence of William Marshall
the younger that the brethren of Roncesvalles obtained the land on
the banks of the Thames at Charing where they subsequently built
their conventual dwelling, their Hospital for the sick, and the Chapel
by the riverside, which were to remain an important feature of London
for over three hundred years.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Saint Mary Roncevall to the Year 1348.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The records of this alien settlement for many years consist mainly
of statements of the gifts received from various important persons.
The community seems to have flourished, and their work, both in
London and in the Pyrenees, continued to deserve the sympathy and
support of their pious benefactors. There is evidence that they possessed
property in Norwich, Canterbury, Oxford, Pevensey, Southampton, and
elsewhere, and that they received certain revenues from Ireland and from
Scotland. It is easy to understand that their Irish revenues may have
been considerable on account of the great estates possessed by the Marshall
family in Leinster. It is clear also that the Convent had the advantage
of royal favour and patronage, for the English records contain several
confirmations of valuable gifts from both Henry III and Edward I,
derived from royal property situated in the South of France, to the mother
house in the Pyrenees. One of the most interesting of these gifts is the
rent to be derived for the benefit of the Convent from the King’s lands
in the town of Myramand, previously granted to Eleanor, the Queen
Mother. This grant is specially mentioned in the same document as
another endowment derived from the same source to be paid to the
Abbey of Fontevraud. This benefaction to the House of Roncesvalles
gives the measure of respect in which it was held, for an English king
who placed the house of Roncesvalles in the same category as the Abbey
of Fontevraud as worthy of support must have felt the claims of the
Convent in the Pyrenees in the strongest possible way. Edward’s
Angevin ancestors had been buried in the Church of Fontevraud for
generations, and there was no ecclesiastical foundation possessing
a greater claim on the munificence of the Angevin family than this
Abbey.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little that is known of the domestic progress of the House at
Charing, in addition to such general indications as are given of its
financial condition, concerns the appointment of certain officials. In
the year 1278, and again in 1280, a certain Henry, son of William
of Smalebrook, was appointed as his attorney for two years on each
occasion by the Prior of the Hospital of Roncesvalles. The inference
to be derived from this is that the weakness inherent in all the alien
houses had already begun to show itself in the community at Charing.
The management of the estates in England was entrusted to agents in
this country, with the consequence that maladministration of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>affairs was very apt to take place, and, as a result, opportunities
frequently arose for the interference of neighbouring magnates or of
the King himself with the affairs of the alien religious houses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Complications of this nature must have taken place about this time
at the House at Charing. In the year 1283 a certain Brother Lupus
appears upon the scene for the first time. His position in England
seems to have been that of envoy coming from the Pope, but in the same
record he is described as a priest, envoy and preceptor of the Houses in
England and Ireland of the Prior and Convent of the Hospital of St.
Mary Roncesvalles, and he no doubt had instructions to supervise the
management of their estates. The arrival of Brother Lupus, “streight
comen fro the court of Rome,” with indulgences for the remission of
sins, is an interesting proof that even so early as the year 1283 the
sale of indulgences was one of the special functions of the brethren of
Roncesvalles, and was no doubt a source of considerable income to the
Priory<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a>. Chaucer, writing a hundred years later, alludes, in his characteristic
ironical manner, to this side of the activities of the Canons of
Roncesvalles;<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and even so late as the year 1432, when the House in
London had come under the influence of the English clergy, a special
effort was made to preserve this source of profit.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An instructive example is afforded by the exploits of Ralph de
“Runcevill,” who is stigmatized as a vagabond monk, but who was
nevertheless strong enough to retain possession of the Priory of
Goldcliff in the Marches of Wales (near Newport, Monmouthshire) in
spite of the efforts of his superior, the Abbot of the very important
Convent of Bec-Hellouin, in Normandy, of which the House at Goldcliff
was a “Cell,” “Calend. Pat. Rolls,” 12-14, Ed. II, (1319-1321).</p>

</div>
<p class='c018'>The year 1290 must have been notable in the annals of the Hospital,
for in that year died Eleanor of Castile, the wife of Edward I, at Harby,
near Lincoln, and the King in pious memory built a sculptured cross
at every place where the body of his consort rested during the funeral
procession to Westminster. The last station in this progress was at
the village of Charing. The hospitality of the brethren must have
been taxed to the utmost to provide accommodation for the retinue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>accompanying the King, even if supplemented by the exertions of the
neighbouring hermitage of St. Catherine. The cross at Charing was
completed in the year 1294, and the brethren no doubt at this time had
many opportunities of conversing with the artists and handicraftsmen
who formed the very flourishing and remarkable school of art at
Westminster, and who were so enthusiastically encouraged both by
Henry III and his son Edward. It is quite possible that the Chapel
of the Convent may have benefited by the advice, or even by the
workmanship of Alexander “the Imaginator,” of Abingdon, and
William de Ireland, whose artistic handiwork formed so prominent a
feature of the Eleanor Crosses.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next records show that officials with foreign names are in
charge of the estate of Roncesvalles in England. In 1292 William de
Cestre and Peter Arnaldi de Santo Michaele are nominated attorneys
for five years for the Prior then staying beyond seas, and again, the
following year, we find Lupus de Canone concerned in the management
of the Roncesvalles property, having a lay person, Arnaldus de Sancto
Johanne, associated with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Evidence of the vigour displayed by Brother Lupus in his
administration of the affairs of the Convent occurs in an entry in the
statement of accounts drawn up by the Executors of Queen Eleanor. It
gives the information that the Executors paid the comparatively large
sum of 14<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> to Brother Lupus, Procurator of the
Hospital of Roncesvalles, as damages claimed by the brethren on
account of their houses at Southampton. This payment was made in the
year 1291, and not only indicates that the estate of Roncesvalles in
England was being watchfully managed, but also gives us the
information that the Convent still possessed the property at
Southampton, originally conveyed to them in the foundation-gift of
William Marshall.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brethren of St. Mary of Roncesvalles at Charing did not fail to
defend their rights when unjust inroads were made on their property.
There are indications that efforts, stimulated no doubt by the Mother
House, were made after periods of lax management—numerous in the
troubled times that followed—to repossess themselves of the rents and
property seized by powerful neighbours. These efforts were in many
cases successful, partly by the good will of charitably disposed persons,
partly by the influence of the Crown, but mainly by the sturdy support
of the rights of their House before the King’s Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the year 1294, the Prior of the Hospital claimed, by writ of entry,
one toft with appurtenances in Westminster from Adam, son of Walter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the Scot. It was admitted that the toft and tenements had been held
fifteen years previously by the Prior, who had lost them by default,
as he did not appear before the Court when the ownership of the
property was in question. The Convent made good its claim, though
it seems that Adam was quite willing to restore the property to the
Convent, but a special inquiry had to be made to show that there was
no collusion in permitting this property to pass in mortmain to the
religious house. It is of interest to note that the Prior, Garcia de
Ochoa, died in November, 1278, and was succeeded by the Prior Juan.
In the year 1279, when this property passed by default, difficulties may
have arisen on account of an interregnum at Roncesvalles.</p>

<p class='c008'>To this period an incident should probably be referred to which
attention is drawn in an undated petition from the Prior, requesting
that property lying before the Cross at Charing, to the extent of 3 acres,
and certain rents, should be restored. This property had been held for
a period of ten years by a certain John of Lincoln, Burgess of London,
and on his death had passed into the hands of the King on account of
default on the part of the Attorney of the Prior and Convent. This
petition quaintly recites as part of the evidence that the property
belonged to the Convent, that the fact was a matter of common
knowledge, “come les gentz dil pais le sauont bien et toute la veisinetee.”
The little incident has a strong resemblance to other successful claims
for their lost lands made under the stimulating influence of Brother
Lupus.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the troubled times when England was engaged in Continental
wars, soon to become almost continuous, communication
between Gascony and England must have been so difficult as to be
well-nigh impossible to men of peace. Convoys under military protection
were in imminent danger of capture, and from what we know,
especially in the case of naval warfare at this period, there were few
of the vanquished who escaped death. In addition to the dangers of
travelling another source of great difficulty was felt by the Prior and
his officials. The King was in constant and urgent need of money to
permit of the prosecution of his warlike policy, and his agents were
not too scrupulous as to how it was obtained. If it could be represented
that the property of the alien religious houses in the King’s dominions
could be used for the support of his enemies abroad, or if it could be
urged in extenuation that funds sent abroad by the alien communities
could be captured in transit, it is evident that the King would have
many excuses and would exercise little scruple in levying heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>contributions on the property of the alien clergy in this country, or
even of confiscating it entirely. It was under these conditions that the
earliest suppressions and confiscations of the alien houses took place.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1321 we have a very suggestive record that William Roberti,
Canon of the Hospital of St. Mary, is appointed Proctor-General in
England for the recovery of their lands and rents. The late Proctor,
John de Roncesvalles, had died, and the Prior in Navarre,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> not being
informed of the fact, did not appoint a new Proctor, “war and other
impediments hindering them, so that their lands and rents were taken
by divers men.” Immediately following, letters of protection are given
to William Roberti to aid him in his task, “in consideration of the
benefits constantly given in that Hospital to poor pilgrims visiting
the shrine of Santiago.” As the result of this vigorous action
the House of St. Mary Roncesvalles at Charing passed through
a period of comparative prosperity, for so late as 1335 a strong
policy still seems to have been pursued. In that year there is an
interesting record of the recovery of 10 acres of land known as
“Roncesvalcroft,” in Kensington. It was stated to have been abandoned
by the brethren and was in the occupation of a certain Simon de
Kensyngton. In such matters, however, the King’s agents were usually
very active. Simon de Kensyngton did not long remain in possession,
for the watchful eyes of William Trussel and Walter de Hungerford,
the King’s escheators, were upon him and they claimed the land for the
Crown. The legal argument in this dispute goes on to state how the
land, not being held directly from the Crown, was restored to the
brethren.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>It was in the second quarter of the fourteenth century that the
community of St. Mary of Roncesvalles in this country appears to have
been most prosperous. The Convent at Charing Cross was the headquarters
of the brethren in our islands. The Procurator for the Prior
who managed the estates and collected the revenues had his residence
there. The property they possessed in London was the most valuable,
and consisted of plots of land in various parts of the suburbs, as well as
at Charing Cross, but the Convent also possessed a considerable amount
of property in Canterbury and at Oxford. Evidence remains that they
derived revenue from property in Norwich and that they had possessions
elsewhere in England, in Wales, in Ireland, and in Scotland. The
income derived from these possessions was sufficient to permit of a
subsidy towards the support of the Mother House in the Pyrenees.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>At Charing Cross itself the Priory possessed a piece of land fronting
on the river and extending back to the roadway between London and
Westminster. The depth of this plot was then not so great as it is
now, for the waters of the river extended much nearer to Charing Cross
than at present.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The position of Inigo Jones’s well-known watergate
at the foot of Buckingham Street, the last relic remaining of York
House, indicates the line of the river bank at a date over two hundred
years subsequent to the time now under consideration.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Charing Cross stood approximately on the site now
occupied by the statue of King Charles I.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Occupying the most easterly part of the river frontage was situated
the Church of the Convent. This Church, or Chapel as it was usually
called in London, was built soon after the foundation of the Convent,
but there is evidence that considerable alterations and additions were
made much later, perhaps at the end of the fourteenth, and again during
the last phase of the existence of the house, in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. Some idea of the appearance of the Chapel and the neighbouring
buildings may be gained by studying two ancient drawings
still in existence, made while the conventual buildings were standing.
One of these is the well-known sketch of London by Anthony Van den
Wyngaerde, dating from the middle of the sixteenth century. The
other is a very beautiful sketch in the Gardner collection which shows
a portion of the south-western end of the chapel, the gardens of the
Convent, and in the distance Whitehall and Westminster. Judging by
the evidence thus obtained, the chapel consisted of a rectangular nave,
built of stone. The type of work indicates that it was built about the
middle of the thirteenth century. There appear to have been two
storeys in this building, the lower storey with three large pointed
windows, and the upper storey with three smaller windows also pointed.
The upper part, with the small windows, may have formed the clerestory.
It is possible, however, that the upper part of the church was
cut off from the lower part, and that this upper storey was lighted by
the three smaller windows alluded to. Instances of this arrangement
are known to have occurred in the churches belonging to hospitals. In
such cases part of the church served the purpose of sheltering the sick,
while at the eastern end was the chapel proper, arranged so that the
sick should have the full benefit of the services of the church.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pitch of the chapel roof was steep, the form most easily constructed
at the period of which we speak, and was no doubt covered
with lead. A belfry was situated at the north-eastern end of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>chapel. Certain buildings of a much later date than the main part of
the edifice, and probably built of brick, are seen to have been added
to the northern and southern ends of the chapel, and along the river
front. From a terrace on the south-east side of the chapel stairs led
down to the water’s edge. Immediately to the west of the chapel were
the Convent gardens, extending in the direction of the roadway to
Westminster, and partly terraced to the river bank. Lying back from
the chapel were the conventual buildings and other tenements in the
possession of the community. These appear to have been arranged
on both sides of a court which opened on the high road close to the
cross.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is stated that over the doorway of each of these houses was
sculptured a cross, according to the use of Roncesvalles. There also
appears to have been a Latin inscription around or near the doorway
of the chapel indicating the date of an addition or restoration in the
time of Henry IV. The exact position occupied by the Hospital itself
cannot be now identified unless, as is very probable, the chapel itself
did duty both as a church and a hospital. The churchyard of the
community was probably situated in the lands to the south-west of the
conventual buildings. The situation of the chapel corresponds approximately
to the middle section of Charing Cross Railway Station in
alignment with York Gate and extending towards the land now occupied
by Craven Street and Northumberland Avenue.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Black Death (1348-49).</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The event which seems to have done more than any other single
cause to depress the fortunes and to change the future relationships of
the foreign community of St. Mary was the catastrophe of the Black
Death. The plague visited London in the autumn of 1348. Its
ravages were serious in the early days of November, and the condition
of affairs had produced so much alarm that Parliament was prorogued
on January 1, 1349. A further prorogation occurred on March 10,
the reason given being that the “pestilence was continuing at Westminster,
in the City of London, and at other places, more severely than
before (<i>gravius solito</i>).” It had diminished, or almost disappeared, in
London by the end of that year. The clergy appear to have suffered
throughout the country even more severely than the rest of the
populace—evidence that they did not fail in their duties during that
terrible period. Geoffrey le Baker, a clerk of Osney, says, “Of the
clergy and cleric class there died a multitude known to God only.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>What actually happened at Charing Cross can only be guessed, but
there are very clear indications that the Convent of St. Mary Roncevall
suffered severely. The deaths among the brethren were probably
numerous, for no one sufficiently important seems to have survived to
uphold the interests of the parent House. The depressed state of the
Convent is the more striking as the calamity occurred after a period of
great prosperity.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the plague ceased, and for some time after, the affairs of the
Convent appear to have been in complete confusion. The immense
mortality during the year of the prevalence of the plague disordered to
a serious extent the whole executive of the country, and especially
affected the Church. In some cases the community in the smaller
convents died out entirely, in others the senior members and officials
completely disappeared from the records, and in all cases serious losses
must have occurred. This fatality was not confined to the monastic
clergy alone; those holding benefices outside the religious houses
perished probably in greater numbers. The consequence was that
throughout the country rapid institutions to vacant benefices had to
be made to carry on the duties of those who had fallen, and frequently
unlettered, and in some cases unworthy, clerks succeeded to important
charges. These difficulties must have been much accentuated in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>case of alien houses. They suffered, as did all the other religious
communities, and in addition, they felt the difficulty of being remote
from the parent House. Officials who would have had the interests of
the House at heart could not be sent from abroad to take charge on
short notice, and the Prior at Roncesvalles, no doubt, did not even
know of the deaths of his subordinates at Charing Cross. The vacant
benefices in the possession of the alien houses were sought for and
obtained by clergy on the spot who had influence, and there can be no
doubt that the conclusion is correct, that many of these persons were
more concerned in advancing their own interests and in retaining the
possessions thus secured, than in guarding the rights of the foreign
abbey or priory. Not only, however, did the local clergy secure the
vacant benefices and property, but in many cases the property of the
alien houses was taken possession of by their influential neighbours,
sometimes without opposition, when the original possessors had entirely
disappeared, at other times by the high hand when the rightful owners
were few or feeble.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Conflict of Interest between Alien and English Clergy at Saint Mary Roncevall (1350-1414).</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>In spite of these adverse conditions the house of St. Mary Roncevall
survived, although new influences appear directing its affairs. The
earliest records after the Plague show that English clergy were in
possession of the Church and Hospital, and the title of Warden is made
use of for the first time by the chief clerical official. Special interest
appears to have been taken in its affairs by the Crown, perhaps because
its estate afforded a ready source of revenue, but more likely on account
of the proximity of the Convent to the Royal Palace at Westminster.
The Church and Hospital afforded convenient opportunities of preferment
and of income to the clergy connected with the Chapel Royal
of St. Stephen or of the Royal Household.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first records after the Plague are of special significance. In
1379, in the reign of Richard II, the chapel and lands of St. Mary
Roncevall were seized into the King’s hands in accordance with the
statute dated at Gloucester, “for the forfeiture of the lands of schismatic
aliens,” and in accordance with the policy of the Crown at this period
to suppress all the alien religious houses. At this time there was a
certain Nicholas Slake, a clerk, who, wise in his generation, had not
failed in procuring preferment and much advantage from the Church.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>He possessed various benefices throughout the country, and finally
became Dean of the Chapel Royal of St. Stephen, Westminster, in the
year 1396.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Nicholas Slake had obtained possession of the revenues
and had become Warden of the Hospital and Chapel of “Rounsyvale,”
probably when the Crown took possession of the property after the
forfeiture of 1379. In 1383, we find that the King grants a writ of
aid for Ralph Archer, Proctor of Nicholas Slake, Master of the Hospital
of St. Mary Roncevall, “to arrest and bring before the King and
Council all persons whom he shall prove to have collected alms in the
realm as Proctor of the Hospital, and converted the same to their
own use.”</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hennessy, “Novum Repertorium Ecclesiasticum Parochiale Londinense.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>It seems probable that an effort had been made by Nicholas Slake
to put the affairs of his church in order, either on his own initiative, or
on account of the renewed interest taken in the house at Charing Cross
by the Mother Convent. It is noteworthy that about this time the Prior
and brethren at Roncesvalles commenced a process at law to claim their
property. An inquisition took place before the King’s Court at Westminster
into the foundation of the Hospital, and as it appeared in
evidence that the chapel and its property belonged to the Prior of
Roncesvalles, it was restored (April 23, 1383).</p>

<p class='c008'>There now appears to have been a short period of quiet and good
fortune for the brotherhood. It will be remembered that the years
1390-92 are known as the three “quiet” years of the Hundred Years’
War with France. Peaceful communications were restored between
Navarre, through France to England, so that we are not surprised to
find that in 1389, Garcias, a Canon of Roncesvalles, is ratified as
Warden of the Chapel of Roncevall by Charing Cross, at the supplication
of the King’s kinsman, Charles of Navarre. What happened in the
next year, 1390, is a little obscure. Garcias does not seem to have
been at home or comfortable at Charing Cross, or the influence of the
London clergy may have prevailed over the alien, for in that year we
note that John Hadham, the King’s clerk, is Warden of the Hospital.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following years must have brought much anxiety to the
remnants of the alien clergy in England. They must have become
more and more conscious of the insecurity of their tenure. England
was once more engaged in deadly war with France; communications
between the two countries were constantly interrupted or carried on
with great risk and danger, and in the case of the Hospital of St. Mary,
the sending of their surplus revenue to Navarre through France must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>have been regarded by the King, constantly seeking funds for military
purposes, with the utmost jealousy. Most of the alien houses had
already been suppressed. The continued existence of the House of
St. Mary Roncevall, as mentioned above, had been seriously threatened.
The affairs, therefore, of the community of Charing Cross must have
been in great disorder and can have afforded little satisfaction to the
parent House. That the Prior did make efforts to supervise the affairs
of the Convent in England is clear, but the control must have been very
ineffective.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1396, John Newerk obtained the wardenship and the property of
the Hospital, including the charters, various apostolic bulls and other
documents, and apparently installed himself comfortably in his benefice,
for in the year 1399 we find that ratification of the estate of Ronceval
was given to Newerk. In the meantime Francis, who was then Prior
at Roncesvalles, learned of the doings of John Newerk, and commenced
a process against him for having broken into the close and houses
belonging to the Prior in the parish of St. Martin’s in the Fields, of
having removed a sealed chest worth 20<i>s.</i>, containing the charters and
other muniments of the hospital, and claimed damages to the extent of
200<i>l.</i> This action seems to have dragged on for a wearisome length
of time, for in the year 1409 special directions are given by the King,
that, “whereas the suit has been long delayed, the justices are ordered
to proceed therein, but not to give judgment without consulting him.”
The plea was concluded in Hilary Term, 1409, and judgment was
given to the effect that at the time of the trespass the close and houses
were the sole and free tenement of the Prior, so that John Newerk was
mulcted in damages to the extent of 100 marks, but he was held not
guilty in respect of the matter of the chest and writings. Though the
Prior was largely successful in this action, his success did not long delay
the only possible issue.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Saint Mary Roncevall passes into the Hands of English Clergy (1414).</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The end of the strife between the Navarrese and English clergy for
supremacy in the House at Charing Cross was not far off. By the year
1414 the few remaining alien priories and convents were suppressed
by Henry V, but what influence this final suppression had on the
activities of the Convent of St. Mary Roncevall is not quite clear.
English clergy were already in possession of the appointments in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Church and Hospital, and the services of the Convent to the people of
London seem to have continued. There arose no question of handing
over the property for secular purposes, and probably there was no
serious dislocation of the usual work of the House. The management
of its affairs must simply have been recognized to be entirely independent
of the Prior and his officials. It is to the credit of both parties
that this separation was accomplished without severe disturbance, for,
as we shall see, communications between the Prior at Roncesvalles and
the Warden of St. Mary Roncevall remained on what seems to have been
a friendly basis. The English wardens who were now appointed were,
so far as is known, men of note, and frequently in close relationship
with the Court.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1417 Walter Sheryngton, Prebendary of Goderynghill, is
confirmed in his possession of the estate and the “free chapel” of
Rouncevall in the Diocese of London. During his tenure of office
there appears to have been an action at law between the Prior of the
Hospital and the Warden, the exact nature of which is uncertain;
but during its course the conditions of the early foundation of the
Convent at Charing Cross came under discussion.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1432 Roger Westwode, who was also a Prebendary of the
Chapel Royal, St. Stephen’s, was Warden of the Chapel or Hospital
of St. Mary Roncevall. He was clearly conscious of the advantages
to be gained by the connexion with the House in the Pyrenees, as he
obtained a royal licence to receive bulls and letters of indulgence for
the profit of his own chapel from the Prior in Navarre, and also to
remit alms for the poor and other monies to the Priory. An echo of
the old difficulties can be noted in this document, as the royal licence
states clearly that the said Priory is “outside our allegiance, and the
licence is to continue so long as there is no war between us and the
King of Navarre.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fortunes of the Hospital in the middle fifteenth century can
only be judged by inference, but there can be little doubt that it
continued to be useful, and that gradually its functions as a place for
the cure of the needy sick became more developed. The co-operation
of nursing sisters must have also become familiar to the London
community by this time. The brethren and sisters had pursued
their avocation in tending and in nursing the infirm from very early
days in the history of the community of St. Mary both in Navarre and
in England. As the religious house became more distinctly a hospital
their services must have been in constantly increasing request.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Establishment of the Fraternity of St. Mary Roncevall (1475).</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The year 1475 marks the official commencement of the last stage
of the existence of the Hospital. In that year a royal charter of
Edward IV records the “foundation of a fraternity or perpetual gild
of a master, two wardens and the brethren and sisters who may
wish to be of the same in the Chapel of St. Mary Rounsidevall by
Charyng Crosse, and of a perpetual chantry of one chaplain to celebrate
divine service at the High Altar in the said chapel.” In 1478 a grant
in mortmain is recorded to the Master, Wardens, Brethren and
Sisters of the Fraternity of the said Chapel or Hospital, and of its
property, revenues and privileges, for the sustenance of the chaplain
and two additional clergy who now seem to have been required for the
services of the chapel, and of “the poor people flocking to the Hospital.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the years following, the affairs of the Hospital seem to have
been administered with energy and prudence, for we have records in
1494, 1495 and 1496 of legal proceedings concerning the property and
privileges of the Hospital, in which the master and wardens vigorously
upheld their position and successfully defended their rights. The
litigation, which seems to have gone on intermittently chiefly for the
recovery of the ancient possessions of the Hospital, appears to have been
brought to a conclusion in the year 1510, when, in the Mastership of
Laurence Long, the fraternity paid the sum of 20<i>s.</i> into the hanaper
for the confirmation of the various charters granted to the fraternity by
the King.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again there seems to have been a period of comparative calm and,
no doubt, of successful performance of the duties of the Hospital.
The fraternity may have even thought that the storm which
burst over the Church in the time of Henry VIII would leave
them unharmed on account of the fulfilment of their useful functions
in the community, for so late as the year 1542, while William
Jenyns was Master, a record can be read giving evidence of their
continuing interest and careful management of their affairs. In this
year they obtained certain property and a wharf in the parish of
St. Margaret, in respect of rents to be paid from a tenement called
the “Shippe” and certain lands in the Parish of St. Clement Danes
without Temple Bar. This, however, is the last deed recorded of the
ancient community, with the exception of the final act which was
very soon to take place.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Dissolution of the Fraternity by Henry VIII (1544).</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The policy of the King, enforced in many cases by the greed of his
agents and other members of the Court, could not leave the Hospital
unscathed, and not even the charitable deeds of the fraternity were
sufficient to save them from dispersion. The grief with which the
master, wardens and members of the fraternity assembled to ratify
their last official act in a corporate capacity may be conceived, and it
is possible to some faint extent to imagine the feelings of despair and
of bitter irony uppermost in the minds of the brethren and sisters when
they heard the words of the Deed of Surrender read aloud. In this
document the master, wardens, brethren and sisters of the fraternity
declared that they are “specially influenced at the present time by
divers causes and considerations to give and concede by this Charter
to the most excellent and invincible prince, our Lord Henry VIII, by
the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of
the Faith and Supreme Head of the Church in England and Ireland,”
their Church, Hospital, and all other property and privileges. The
affixing of their Common Seal to this document concludes the
chequered history of the Convent of St. Mary Roncevall at Charing
Cross (November 11, 1544).</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the remaining members of the Community were deprived
of their offices and ejected from the home which they had so long
possessed at Charing Cross, their lot was not so hard as in the case
of many others driven into the world at this time. A pittance from
their income was left. There may be read in a book of payments
of Edward VI, under the heading “Pencions out of Monasteries” that
the guardians of Roncevall were allotted the munificent annual income
of 6<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Very oddly in this document the larger sum of 8<i>l.</i> is
entered and crossed out in favour of the smaller amount mentioned.
The amount of the pension was measured with parsimonious exactness.
Quarterly payments of 33 shillings and 4 pence are entered as being
paid to the few surviving members of the fraternity so late as at
Christmas, the Annunciation, Midsummer and Michaelmas, 1551 and 1552.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Later History of the Estate of Roncevall.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The subsequent fate of the Chapel and Hospital and the land on
which they stood may be shortly stated. The site was granted, no
doubt with the buildings on it, in the year 1550 to Sir Thomas
Cawarden.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Cawarden had been master of the revels to Henry VIII
and had established claims to reward or remuneration from the King
which had not been satisfied on his death. He was able to establish
and enforce these claims in the early years of Edward VI. With some
difficulty he obtained in discharge of his claims on the Crown the estate
and property of Roncevall and also the church and property of the
Blackfriars within the City of London. He seems also to have secured
at this time the stewardship of Nonsuch Palace and its lands in the
County of Surrey.</p>

<div class='fn'>

Charles L. Kingsford, Clarendon Press, 1908, i, p. 341; ii, p. 350.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The properties of Roncevall and of the Blackfriars soon passed from
the hands of Cawarden, probably during the period of wild speculation
in land and real estate which followed the dissolution of the religious
houses, but the stewardship of Nonsuch he continued to hold with much
tenacity in spite of the efforts to dislodge him from this favourite
position by Cardinal Pole during the reign of Queen Mary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cawarden died in the year 1559. In the meantime the Roncevall
property had passed to Sir Robert Brett. It was purchased early in the
seventeenth century by Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, who
built himself a town house, described as a “sumptuous palace,” on the
site, using for the purpose the material of the ancient Convent. This
house was completed in the year 1605 and was known for some years
as Northampton House. It consisted of buildings arranged on three
sides of a quadrangle, and open towards the garden and river. From
him the property passed by inheritance to his nephew, Thomas Howard,
first Earl of Suffolk, the second son of Thomas, fourth Duke of Norfolk,
who completed the quadrangle, the house being then known as Suffolk
House. From the Howard family the property passed by an heiress to
Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland, in 1642; another heiress of
the Percy family brought the property to Charles Seymour, Duke
of Somerset. While in the possession of the Somerset family and their
immediate successors, the Strand front was much improved and
acquired the architectural features so long associated with Northumberland
House at Charing Cross. By another heiress, Lady Elizabeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Seymour, the property passed into the possession of the present Duke
of Northumberland’s family.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of the construction of the Thames Embankment,
and the necessity for making a wide approach from Charing Cross, the
late Metropolitan Board of Works bought the property from the Duke
of Northumberland, in 1874, for the sum of £500,000. Northumberland
House, the last of the old river-side mansions, was completely demolished
and now Northumberland Avenue and the great buildings near it occupy
the site of the Convent and Hospital of St. Mary Roncevall.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Most of the ancient documents dealing with the history of the Priory
have been destroyed or lost as the result of war, fires and other
causes. There remains in the Library at Roncesvalles an unpublished
MS. dealing with the early history of the Priory and its dependencies,
written about the second quarter of the seventeenth century by Don
Juan Huarte. This MS. incorporates information obtained by the writer
from various sources, and especially under the date April 12, 1623,
from a certain Brother Miguel de Spiritu Sancto, who derived it in his
turn from a certain Don Francisco Olastro—(Francis Oliver?)—who is
stated to have been an ambassador from England in Madrid. This
document states that there is situated in the suburbs of London a wide
street named “the Street of Our Lady of Roncesvalles.” The houses in
this street have sculptured over their doorways a single cross
according to the use of Roncesvalles. At the end of the street is a
large building, now nearly dismantled, which was a sumptuous church in
the time of the Catholic Religion. Over the portico of the church were
sculptured three crosses of the same form, and in addition there was a
clearly engraved Latin inscription to the effect that this church was
built and completely finished in honour of the Blessed Virgin by Henry
IV, King of England, who, in addition, granted to the Community of St.
Mary of Roncevall large possessions and revenues for the service of
the Priory and Hospital. The inscription is dated in the MS. 1378, but
this date, which is clearly impossible, is probably an error of
transcription for 1408, arising from peculiarities in the formation of
the figures, and there are other errors to be noted, showing that the
information is derived through indirect channels. The inscription is
given as follows:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Henricus quartus Dei gratia Rex Angliæ, Iberniæ et Irlandæ, Princeps
Gales, et Dux (<i>Lancastrie?</i>). Hanc ecclesiam sacratissimæ Virginis et
Matris Mariæ construxit locupletavit et a fundamentis edificavit, et eam in
honorem dictæ Sanctissimæ Virginis et Matris multis possessionibus et
redditibus et inquiliniis ditavit, et eam cum suis omnibus possessionibus,
inquiliniis subditis et redditibus donavit in donum perpetuum ordini et
hospitali generali coenobii Sanctæ Mariæ Roncesvallis in anno domini
Salvatoris nostri Jhesu Christi, MCCCLXXVIII.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The document goes on to say that the Priory possessed in England property
including the Chapel and Convent at Charing Cross (“Caringrasso”) of the
yearly value of 9,300 pounds English money, corresponding to 8,223 Spanish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>ducats, and that it also owned property in Canterbury (“Conturbel”) of the
yearly value of 4,000 pounds, and in Oxford (“Oxonia”) of 5,700 pounds.
A Procurator was appointed directly by the Abbot at Roncesvalles, who had
his headquarters in London at Charing Cross, and had complete powers of
administration to deal with the property of the Convent scattered through
England, Scotland, and Ireland, and he also directed the Hospital and other
enterprises of the Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Huarte MS. also states that, in the ancient archives of the Abbey
there existed a record in alphabetical arrangement, from which it is
gathered that Henry VI of England, finding that no official was being
sent from Roncesvalles, directed one of his chaplains to obtain from
Roncesvalles an account of the property in London and Charing Cross
belonging to the Priory: “Las pertenecientes á la capilla y encomienda
de Roncesvalles situada junto á Caringrasso de Inglaterra,”
and a warrant to collect the income and charitable
contributions and send them to Roncesvalles for the maintenance of the
clergy and the poor. There is also a statement on the authority of a
“military personage in the City of London,” that there existed in
London a large house which had belonged to Roncesvalles, as shown by
the crosses of the special form used by the Order still to be seen on
the stones, and that this house had been converted into a seminary of
the Anglican Church.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be observed that much of the information in the Huarte MS. is
traditional and cannot be accepted without careful collation with the more
complete and authentic information contained in the English records. It is,
however, of much interest to know that a document perpetuating the memory
of the Hospital of Roncevall in London still exists in the parent House.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Illustrations.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Fig. 1.</span>—The Chapel of St. Mary Roncevall on the bank of the
Thames previous to 1544. The chapel is of the middle of the thirteenth
century, in two storeys, with later additions, probably of the Tudor
period, to the south of the church and at the north-east angle. The
tower and belfry are at the north-east end of the church. The chapel
is built on a terrace, faced by a high wall, pierced by a door giving
access by steps to the river. The sketch gives indications of portions
of the conventual buildings, some of which may be identified by
referring to the inventory contained in the grant to Sir Thomas
Cawarden; for instance, the gardens, the churchyard, wharf, the
almshouse. The Cross at Charing, St Martin’s Church of that period,
other features in the village of Charing, and St. Giles’s in the
Fields, may be identified.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fig. 2.</span>—A chart of the Western Pyrenees, showing the roads
through the passes, and the position of Roncesvalles and Ibañeta.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Figs.</span> 3 and 4.—The effigy of William Marshall, Earl of
Pembroke (<i>ob.</i> 1219), in the Temple Church.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Figs.</span> 5, 6, and 7.—The effigy of William Marshall, Earl of
Pembroke, son of the preceding (<i>ob.</i> 1231). These figures of the
Marshalls are from Edward Richardson’s “Monumental Effigies of the
Temple Church.” Longmans, 1843. William Marshall, sen., the regent,
and his son were closely associated with the Knights Templars, and
benefactors of the Order. It will be noted that the effigy of the
father shows the figure in a straight position, whereas the effigy of
the son is in the cross-legged attitude. The question is naturally
raised as to the significance of the cross-legged position. There is
no doubt that William Marshall the elder did go to the Holy Land in
fulfilment of the dying request of Henry, the eldest son of Henry II,
in the years 1185-87. In the case of the son there is no evidence of a
journey to Palestine, though it is possible that he may have taken
part in campaigns against the Moors in Spain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Fig. 8.</span>—A copy of an ancient drawing lately in the possession
of Mr. E. Gardner, now in the collection of Sir Edward F. Coates,
Bart. The drawing is supposed to be contemporary and to have been the
work of an early Italian artist resident in England. It was purchased
at the Strawberry Hill sale by Dr. Wellesley for the Gardner
collection; and the Marquis of Salisbury is stated to have several
drawings by the same early Italian artist. The sketch shows part of
the north-westerly aspect of the Chapel of St. Mary Roncevall, with
some of the later Tudor additions. The battlements were probably added
when additions were built, perhaps in the time of Henry IV, or later.
The Tudor chimneys appearing over the battlements are reminiscent of
the work of Cardinal Wolsey at Hampton Court and would have been
constructed in brick. The building on the extreme left of the sketch
is probably the corner of a north porch. The sketch also shows the
gardens of the Convent of which very special note is made in
Cawarden’s inventory, and in the distance the buildings of Whitehall
and of Westminster.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><span class='sc'>Fig. 9.</span>—Copy of an official stamp now used in the Priory,
showing the Cross of Roncesvalles.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Figs.</span> 10 and 11.—The common seal of the Fraternity and Guild
of St. Mary Roncevall. The seal appears to be of the fifteenth century
and was no doubt the seal specially mentioned as being given to the
Fraternity by Edward IV. The seal is round, the engraved part being
2-1/4 in. in diameter. Unfortunately the impression is imperfect.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 10 is from a cast taken by Doubleday in the middle of the last
century.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fig. 11 is from a cast taken by Mr. Ready from the impression still
attached to the Deed of Surrender. It will be noted on careful
examination that there are certain interesting differences in the
state of preservation of these two casts. The seal on the Deed of
Surrender has been backed and strengthened, but this repair does not
altogether account for the differences noticed in the impressions. It
is possible that another impression may have existed when Doubleday
made his cast. The seal represents “the assumption of the Virgin, who
is standing on a crescent upheld by an angel and surrounded by
radiance. At each side three flying angels issuing from clouds.
Overhead in clouds the Trinity. The legend reads:—</p>

<p class='c008'>The author cannot conclude this account of the Convent and Hospital
without expressing his cordial thanks to those from whom he has sought
assistance and criticisms. He desires especially to acknowledge his
obligations to Mr. E. Salisbury and other officials of the Public Record
Office for their courteous and patient guidance; to Mr. E. Gardner for
his kind permission to see the valuable collection of material illustrating
the history of London formerly in his possession, and to reproduce one
of the drawings in this paper; to Mr. Herbert Wigglesworth and his
assistant, Mr. L. H. Glencross, for drawings of the Chapel of St. Mary,
and for important criticisms respecting its structure and architectural
features; and to Don José Urrutia, the Abbot-Prior, and Don Ignacio
Ibarbia Fernandez de Guevara, Canon of Roncesvalles, for much
information respecting the present state of the Convent, and for their
sympathetic interest in the history of one of the ancient “cells” of
the Real Colegiata.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c013' />
<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Tradition</span> for over six hundred years has conferred the
title of the “Good Queen Eleanor” on the Consort of Edward I, and does
not fail to repeat the tale of one of the most beautiful episodes in
the domestic annals of the mediæval English court; but the force of
this tradition has, without doubt, been greatly strengthened by the
existence of the remarkable series of monuments erected by King Edward
to perpetuate the memory of the Queen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The story of the “Regina bonæ memoriæ” may be of interest to
those who read these pages, not only because the Cross erected at
Charing was the finest of the memorial crosses, but because the artistic
conception and much of the excellent craftsmanship lavished on these
beautiful monuments had their origin in the district of London specially
associated with the work of Charing Cross Hospital.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will first of all be needful to recall something of the life and
character of a Queen who made so powerful an impression on her
people. That her influence must have been remarkable is sufficiently
indicated by the fact that the crosses partook of the nature of shrines.
They were built on consecrated ground and were intended to claim the
prayers of the wayfarer. This great demand on the devotion of her
people, which might readily have given the impression of being forced
or exaggerated, was clearly held to be entirely fitting.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Coming of Eleanor to England.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The omens at the commencement of Eleanor’s career in England
were by no means favourable, and little indicated the event. At the age
of about nine, Eleanor, a princess of Castile, was married to Edward, the
heir to the English Crown, who had reached the mature age of fifteen
years. The marriage took place in the year 1254, in the ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>city of Burgos, and was celebrated with the utmost pomp; but the
magnificence of the occasion fails to conceal the features of the hard
diplomatic bargain driven between Henry III, the father of the bridegroom,
and Alfonso X of Leon and Castile, Eleanor’s half-brother. As
a condition of this treaty Alfonso merged all his claims and rights in
Guienne and the South of France in the English Crown; and the
marriage, arranged after much difficulty, placed the seal on this compact,
terminating a long period of petty warfare and intrigue, during which
Alfonso had sought to encourage the Gascons and other Gallic subjects
of Henry against their liege lord.</p>

<p class='c008'>This Spanish marriage was by no means a popular one amongst the
English; and although in the following year, 1255, when Eleanor came
to London, her reception was marked with much circumstance and
great official cordiality, it is clear that the Londoners had no great love
for the Spaniards. Henry had given sufficient reason for the people’s
jealousy of foreigners; his prodigality and many acts of favouritism
already shown to foreign relations of the royal house and their retainers
gave good earnest that a similar outburst of extravagance on the part
of the King would result from this Spanish invasion. Preceding the
arrival of Eleanor, an embassy led by her brother, Don Sancho, the
young Archbishop of Toledo, had arrived to make certain preliminary
arrangements. They had been greeted with only a modified degree of
favour by the London populace. Their manners were considered to
be anything but up to the London standard. Under an aspect of
richness and profusion their habits were considered to be sordid and
mean; one of the complaints made by the grumbling Londoners was
that the Spaniards, not content with hanging the walls of their lodging
with tapestry, must also use tapestry for covering the floors! The unfortunate
young Prelate himself on riding through the streets of London
had ventured to confer his benediction on the populace with upraised
hand—an act which was interpreted with but little generosity. The
hapless ten years old Princess and wife presents a pathetic picture, for
in the midst of all this political intrigue even the little maiden herself
did not escape the animadversions of her future people. Special notice
is taken of the fact that though landing with a great retinue at Dover,
and with much bravery of outward attire, she had but a very scanty
wardrobe (<i>minus bene munita hernesio</i>). One of the first disbursements
on the part of Henry for his daughter-in-law was to remedy this
grave defect.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The young Prince, her husband, appears to have been a headstrong
and undisciplined young man; though nominally in possession of great
estates in France and England, his actual income in money was small,
and he and his friends and retainers seem to have lived on the land as if
they were a band of foreign robbers. Edward’s thoughtlessness and the
harshness and cruelty of those around him are unfavourably commented
on at this time. The hard discipline, which the young Prince received
in the years immediately following, was very necessary to render him
the great king of England which he subsequently became, and many
years also were required before the little Princess acquired the gracious
firmness of character which is recognized in the “Regina bonæ
memoriæ” of English history.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Early Influences affecting Eleanor’s Character.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The young Princess did not stay long in England at this time. She
returned to the Continent, no doubt to continue her education under the
influence of her royal relatives in Spain and France. Her half-brother,
Alfonso, was a man of much ability and high culture. His astronomical
researches are known to this day, and he is distinguished by the title of
“El Sabio” among the early Kings of Spain. Eleanor’s education was,
therefore, carried on under conditions more favourable than might be
expected in such a troubled age. The influences thus exerted on her
developing character left their mark throughout her life, and more than
once her love of beautiful things and the encouragement she gave to
learning appear in the fragmentary records of her history.</p>

<p class='c008'>Edward, on the other hand, probably gained little in the way of
discipline or of military or political training from his father. It was in
the merciless school of rebellion and civil strife that he was to receive
his first hard lessons, the results of which may be traced throughout
his career. His early association with Simon de Montfort, a leader of
much genius, afforded him his first training in warfare. This training
never stood him in better stead than when, after his final rupture with
this great leader, the battle of Evesham gave him the opportunity of
putting in practice what he had learned against his old master. At the
same time his experience of the meaner side of the miserable politics of
this period produced the distortion of Edward’s character which marred
many of his great actions in the future.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not till the Barons’ Wars were approaching their termination
that Eleanor definitely took up her residence in England. The domestic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>life of the young Prince and Princess may be reckoned as commencing
about the year 1264, ten years after their marriage, when their eldest
child, named after her mother, was born. Eleanor seems to have lived
a very domesticated life,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> principally at Windsor and in her Castle at
Guildford, and there is evidence that her gracious character and many
acts of kindness to the neighbouring people soon began to have their
inevitable effect. She showed early the desire to accompany her
husband on his travels, one of the most characteristic features of her
later life. Edward, on the other hand, was still under the shadow of his
father. The state of English politics was exceedingly perturbed, and
the King’s eldest son was much involved in the intrigues of the time.
The strength of Edward’s character frequently showed itself by courage
and enterprise in the field of battle, by political insight and evidences of
good statesmanship; but his impetuosity and his lack of consideration
led to frequent acts of harshness which must have alienated many who
would otherwise have been supporters of the royal house, and his
conduct in private must have frequently been a cause of anxiety and
mental distress to his young Princess.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Eleanor did not escape experience of the alarms of war,
even at this early age, as may be inferred from the sudden orders for
the retirement of the Princess and her household from Windsor to
Westminster after the battle of Lewes. (Foedera i, part ii, p. 563.)</p>
</div>

</div>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Eleanor journeys to the Holy Land with Edward.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>There must have been, therefore, a great sense of relief to many
within the land when, in the year 1270, Edward, having taken the
Cross, entrusted his children and all his possessions to his uncle Richard
and departed to join the French King on crusade to the Holy Land.
The dangers from pestilence and sword besetting such expeditions to the
East were perfectly well understood—repeated and painful experience
had brought them home to all, both of high and of low degree. With
this full knowledge Eleanor made the momentous decision to accompany
her husband and to share the trials and dangers of the crusade.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before they had actually left France on their journey to the East,
intelligence was received of the death of Louis of France, the leader of
this crusade, in Tunis, and although it must have been clear to Edward
that the chance of a successful issue of the crusade was much
diminished, nevertheless, accompanied by his comparatively small
English force, he went on towards Palestine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next two years were spent in the East. The crusade ended in
failure, scarcely relieved by the exploits of Edward in raising the siege of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Acre, at the battle of Nazareth, and in one or two smaller engagements.
From among the incidents of the crusade, the attempted assassination of
Edward by an emissary of one of the Sultan’s emirs stands out most
clearly. During the struggle Edward was badly wounded in his arm.
The wound suppurated, the arm swelled, and threatened to become
gangrenous. At this juncture the physician in the household of the
Master of the Temple was called in to advise, and stated his opinion that
the only chance of recovery was by means of free incision of the affected
arm. Edward decided that this should be done. On hearing the
decision of her husband, the Princess, worn out with anxiety, broke
down completely, and had to be conveyed from the tent in charge of her
brother-in-law, Edmund, and John De Vescy.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The operation was then
performed, and Edward made a satisfactory recovery. During his
convalescence, he must have owed much to the devoted care of his wife
and to the skill of his medical attendants. It was during these three
years of close association, while Edward had to bear the trial of repeated
disappointments in addition to the severe hardships and imminent perils
of foreign warfare, that a bond of firm comradeship was formed between
the future King and Queen.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Eleanor had three children before leaving England, and during her
years of travel in the East and in France, two, if not three, more had been
born; of these, Joan of Acre, of romantic memory, and a son Alphonso,
for some years heir to the English crown, survived. It can hardly be a
matter of doubt that the number of her children added to the hardships
of her long journeys, and the almost certain incidence of disease had an
adverse influence on the health of the future Queen.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Return to England.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>On their return journey, while resting in Sicily, the Prince and
Princess received the intelligence of the deaths first of their eldest son
John, and then of King Henry. Their homeward journey was, however,
still greatly delayed; Edward running the fantastic risks of a knight-errant
in Burgundy, and becoming embroiled in bouts of partisan warfare
in the South of France, while the Queen visited her royal relatives
in Spain, and rested for some time at Bayonne, where her son Alphonso
was born.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not till late in the following year that they returned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>England, when both Edward and Eleanor were hallowed and crowned
at Westminster amidst surroundings of the greatest magnificence, and
with the promise of a fortunate reign, especially in their relationship
with the King of Scotland (19th August, 1273).</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the first great designs of Edward’s statesmanship was to secure
the more complete subjection of Wales to the English crown. Eleanor’s
influence appears to have been exerted to moderate the impetuosity and
harshness of her husband, and to add the occasional touch of graciousness
which became notably absent when her guiding hand was removed.
Llewelyn II, the Prince of Wales, had been in close terms of intimacy
with the de Montfort family, and was betrothed to Eleanor, the King’s
cousin and only daughter of the great Earl Simon. On her way to
Wales from France in 1276, the ship conveying this lady was captured
by Bristol sailors. The distinguished captive was promptly sent to
Edward at Windsor. Eleanor de Montfort was too valuable a counter
in the game of Edward’s politics to be given up easily, and she was
accordingly kept in captivity in order to influence the negotiations with
the Welsh Prince. The rigour of her captivity, however, was much
alleviated by the action of the Queen, whose kindness and consideration
stands out in pleasant relief to the unremitting harshness of Edward’s
dealings with Llewelyn. The unfortunate Princess, Eleanor de
Montfort, died soon after her marriage, after giving birth to a daughter,
and happily did not witness the savage outburst signalising Edward’s
final triumph over Llewelyn. Accompanied by the Queen, Edward
gradually established himself in Wales. In 1284, Eleanor’s son, Edward,
was born at Carnarvon, and the Welsh once more received a native-born
Prince, but the episode of Eleanor’s kindness to the de Montfort
Princess and her presence with Edward during the later stages of the
occupation of Wales, were no doubt factors of great assistance to Edward
in bringing his Welsh policy to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following years of Eleanor’s life seem to have passed in much
contentment in the midst of her numerous family. She still retained
her custom of accompanying her husband on his travels, and undertook
in his company another long voyage to France and probably to Spain.
The memory of her domestic happiness is recalled by the traditions
which still remain of the gaiety which distinguished the “Maiden Hall”
at Westminster.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Queen, however, did not entirely escape trial and mental anxiety
even in her relationship with her daughters. She keenly felt Edward’s
decision that her daughter, Princess Mary, a girl aged 6, should take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>veil and enter the great Benedictine nunnery of Amesbury. Edward
seems to have been forced to this harsh decision by the masterful
influence of the Queen Mother, Eleanor of Provence, who was living in
retirement in this convent. The Princess Mary survived to the year
1332, and saw much of the trouble which subsequently befell the
Royal House.</p>

<p class='c008'>Records remain which show that Edward allowed himself to relax
from the severity of the warrior and the statesman in the domestic
circle. His domestic relaxation seems to have been often of a boisterous
character. There is, for instance, the story of the King being held in
bed by seven of the Queen’s ladies and damosels on the morning of Easter
Monday, 1290, till he paid them the fine of £14 expected on that day.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
On another occasion, in the same year, Matilda of Waltham, stated to be
the King’s laundress, wins a wager from the King by venturing to ride
his horse, when he had gone hunting in Essex. The King recovered
his steed by paying a fine of 40s. to the bold Matilda.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Last Year of the Queen’s Life.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The year 1290, however, was to be distinguished by events of far
more serious import than the records of domestic happiness. Edward,
secure in England, had reached, perhaps, the culminating point of a
successful career. His judgment was appealed to and his advice followed
in foreign lands; and the great political design of bringing about the
union of the Scottish and English crowns, so often the dream of
his predecessors, now appeared to promise a successful issue by the
betrothal of Prince Edward to his cousin, Margaret of Norway,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a> the
grand-daughter of Alexander III, and heiress to the Scottish throne.
Eleanor’s influence must have been willingly exerted to bring about so
happy a solution of the long drawn out Anglo-Scottish dispute.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r27'>27</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The “Maid of Norway” was King Edward’s grand-niece, and
first cousin “once-removed” to the Prince.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Earlier events of importance in 1290 in Eleanor’s domestic life were
the marriages of her two daughters, Joan of Acre and Margaret. The
celebrations which distinguished the latter event were of so striking a
character that their record remains to this day as an example of the
extreme of mediæval magnificence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Already, however, the tragic events which closed this year were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>throwing their shadows over the land. The Queen’s health was not as
it should be,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a> and a rumour rapidly gained credence that Margaret was
dead in Orkney, where she had rested on her voyage from Norway to
Scotland. The question of the succession to the Scottish Crown, with
all its dangerous consequences, was immediately opened up, and it is
clear that Edward promptly came to the conclusion that he must be in
a position to bring about a result favourable to the English interest.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r28'>28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is some evidence that a daughter was added to the

</div>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Journey to Harby and the Queen’s Fatal Illness.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The summer session of Parliament in Westminster was adjourned, but
re-assembled during the autumn, and Edward left London on 21st July,
travelling northwards accompanied as usual by the Queen. By slow
stages they reached Harby<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> near Lincoln, where the Queen remained
at the house of Richard de Weston, who was no doubt a relative of Sir
John de Weston, a confidential member of her own household. It is
clear that the Queen was unable to bear the fatigues of travelling, and
as the autumn session of Parliament was summoned to meet at King’s
Clipstone, a royal residence in Sherwood Forest, Edward was anxious
that Eleanor should be sufficiently close at hand for him to have full
knowledge of her health. During the month of September he made
short journeys in the districts of the Peak and Sherwood Forest, and
paid a visit to Harby on 11th September. The Clipstone Parliament
occupied his attention during most of October and the early part of
November.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>During the whole of this period the Queen was steadily declining in
health. It is interesting to note one or two indications of the nature of
her long illness. It is on record that a certain Henry de Montepessulano<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
received on 18th October the sum of 13s. 4d. on account of syrups and
other medicines purchased for the Queen at Lincoln.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> The Queen’s
physician was a certain Magister Leopardus, who is specially mentioned
in the Queen’s will as receiving a legacy of 20 marks. In addition to
the physician attached to her household she seems to have been
attended by some of her own countrymen—the physician to the King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of Aragon is especially mentioned. To him the Queen presented a
silver goblet, worth 12-1/2 marks, and Sir Garcia de Ispannia, who was
evidently of the King and Queen’s household, received a certain sum
for a cross given to the Queen.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The character of the illness is described by a contemporary annalist
as being of a lingering character, associated with low fever.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> In
spite of all skill and care the Queen steadily became worse, till at
length the illness must have been recognized as fatal. Another
annalist speaks of the Queen as being stricken with a serious
illness.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>At the close of the Clipstone Parliament, Edward travelled slowly
towards Harby, arriving there on the 20th November. The gravity of
the Queen’s illness seems scarcely to have been appreciated by the King.
He spent six days on his journey from Clipstone to Harby—a distance
of little more than 20 miles. On his arrival the hopelessness of the
Queen’s condition must have been apparent to him. She died on the
evening of the 28th November.</p>

<p class='c008'>Evidence of the King’s grief and depression is given not only by the
contemporary writers, but by Edward’s actions at the time of the death
of Eleanor and during the subsequent months. The gracious character
of the Queen’s influence on her consort, and the affection she inspired
in her people, is amply testified by the contemporary annalists. Walsingham,
once more quoting his predecessors such as Rishanger, describes
her shortly in the following sentence: “She was in very truth a woman
of pious, gracious, and compassionate disposition, the friend of all
English folk, and as a pillar of the whole realm.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a> The important
point of this description is the emphasis laid on the fact that Eleanor
was the friend of her English subjects. This had not been the characteristic
of her predecessors. In the time of Henry III, the foreign
relatives of both the Queen and the King swarmed into England, and
memories of the unjust favours showered upon them still rankled in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>minds of the people. An echo of this can still be heard on listening to
the tale of the annalist at Dunstable. He writes from the English point
of view, and is chiefly concerned with describing the benefits received
by his Convent from the King and Queen.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>After the obsequies at Westminster were concluded, the King went
into retirement in the religious house of the “Bons Hommes” at
Ashridge, issuing to pay a visit to his mother and daughter in the
Convent at Amesbury.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Queen’s death marks the crisis of Edward’s career. His kingly
manner and appearance, his renown as a warrior, and his success as a
statesman, combined to make him one of the most prominent personages
in Europe. The political problems of the future might well have been
solved by his firmness and skill had not the distortion of his character,
which dates back to his early years, become more pronounced. Especially
in the management of the Scottish difficulty, his firmness of
purpose contrasts curiously with the meanness and shiftiness of his
administration. These base qualities more than anything else brought
to so unhappy a termination his statesmanlike plans for the union of
England and Scotland. This great political scheme ended with Edward’s
life in the dark scene at Burgh-on-the-Sands, marked by the desire for
savage revenge<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a> only too characteristic of Edward’s worse nature. At
no period of his career did Edward miss the moderating influence of
Eleanor of Castile more than during his quarrel with Scotland.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>King Edward’s Plan for the Commemoration of Queen Eleanor.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It is quite clear that Edward must have carefully considered the
most fitting means for the perpetuation of the memory of his consort
during the anxious weeks of Eleanor’s last illness. It would have been
otherwise impossible to put into immediate operation the details of his
great design.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plan which commended itself to the King was that after the
body had been embalmed a funeral procession should be formed, led
by himself and accompanied by the important officers of State, and
should pass through England from Lincoln to London. The itinerary
was so arranged that at the close of each day’s march the cortège should
rest for the night near some important town, or at a religious house of
note. The route thus determined was not the most direct.</p>

<p class='c008'>He spent Advent Sunday, December 2, 1290, in Lincoln, the body
resting at the Priory of St. Catherine, on the southern outskirt of the
city, while the King chose the situation for the first of the tombs under
the great eastern window of Lincoln Minster, and attended the memorial
services in that great Church.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving Lincoln on 3rd December, the procession passed through
Grantham, Stamford and Geddington, reaching Northampton on the
9th December; then, by way of Stony Stratford, through Woburn and
Dunstable to St. Albans, which was reached on the 13th December. The
King went thence direct to London, to make due preparation for the
ceremonial entry into the City, while the procession conveying the
remains of Eleanor passed on to Waltham Abbey, in order later to pass
through the length of the City. The procession through the City of
London was of the most solemn character, being led by the King,
accompanied by the important nobles, the officials of the Court, the
prelates and the higher clergy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The night following the departure from Waltham, the body rested
at the western end of Chepe (Cheapside), or perhaps actually in St. Paul’s,
the next night, in the village of Charing, on the confines of Westminster,
and the entombment in the Abbey Church of St. Peter’s took place on
the 17th December.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three tombs were to be erected in memory of the Queen—one in
the Cathedral Church of Lincoln, where the viscera were buried; one
in the Church of the Dominican Friars in London, a religious fraternity
which had early gained the sympathy of the King and Queen. In this
beautiful Church of the Black Friars, built mainly by the munificence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Edward and his consort, the heart of the Queen was to be enshrined
at her own request. The third tomb was erected in the Chapel of
St. Edward the Confessor, where the body is interred. The King determined
that at every station on this route where the Queen’s body rested
for the night a memorial cross should be erected in the most sumptuous
manner possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ceremonies which took place at these various stations were
solemnly conducted with the full rites of the Church, and we still have
evidence of what took place at Dunstable and St. Albans. The Dunstable
annalist states that the body rested one night there—probably in
the choir of the Priory Church—and the bier remained in this place
while the Chancellor and the other magnates of the Court selected a
suitable place for the erection of the Cross. The Prior of the Convent
was present at the ceremony, and consecrated the spot by sprinkling
holy water. The Priory received two valuable pieces of embroidery

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r38'>38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was not the first time that Edward presented gifts
to the Priory at Dunstable, including the valuable embroideries on
cloth of gold of Eastern origin, “<i>scilicet Baudekyns</i>,”
<i>i.e.</i>, cloth of Bagdad, where this gorgeous fabric was
originally made.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>At St. Albans, as was to be expected of the greater house, the ceremonies
must have been conducted with even greater magnificence.
The procession was met as it approached St. Albans by the whole
Convent, “<i>solemniter revestitus in albis et capis</i>,” at the Church of
St. Michael, near the entrance of the town. The body was then conducted
to the Abbey Church and placed before the High Altar. The
whole of that night the Convent was engaged in its divine offices and
holy vigils. There can be no doubt that this progress passing through
so much of the land, accompanied by the King and the great magnates
of the Court, honoured by the most ceremonious rites of Holy Church,
and ending with the great celebration at Westminster, was one of the
most remarkable spectacles ever witnessed in England.</p>

<p class='c008'>The idea of this impressive ceremonial was no doubt suggested to
the mind of Edward by the funeral of his old leader on crusade—Louis
IX of France. After the death of Louis in Tunis, his body was
conveyed to France for entombment. It was carried on men’s shoulders
from Paris to St. Denis, and at the places where the bearers rested on
their journey a cross was subsequently built. It is well known that
Edward held the memory of Louis in great veneration, and was well
aware of these circumstances; no doubt he had seen the crosses in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>memory of St. Louis while in France and accompanied by the
Queen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides arranging for the construction of the tombs and crosses,
Edward made very ample provision for the religious celebrations to be
made in memory of his wife. These were conducted in many places
throughout the land, but the most elaborate was that held annually
up to the time of Henry VIII in Westminster Abbey, on the eve of
St. Andrew’s Day, the 29th November.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>The Builders of the Queen’s Monuments.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>Edward was well aware that he had both the men and the materials
for the accomplishment of this great design. Although the King was
unable to devote much of his time to artistic matters, he could not have
been the son of his father without having a cultivated taste and a
competent knowledge of the arts and crafts of the time. His father,
Henry III, however much he failed as a ruler in an age when the power
of the King was the main factor of good government, was an enthusiastic
lover of art and a patron of artists. It was during the reign of
Henry, and largely owing to his influence, that perhaps the most remarkable
development of Early English architecture took place. His principal
work, to which he gave himself with the utmost devotion, and, indeed,
with little consideration of other and more important duties, was the
rebuilding and decorating of the Abbey Church at Westminster. For
the carrying out of his designs he had gradually fostered a school of
architects, sculptors, painters, and other artists in Westminster unrivalled
in England. This Westminster School of Art not only produced a
great part of the magnificent edifice of the Abbey Church, but was
directly engaged in the construction of many other great churches and
buildings. Its influence, however, was still wider. From it trained and
skilled men travelled throughout Britain, imparting the knowledge of
structure and artistic design, while artists and students came to learn
the Westminster methods from the ends of the land.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is, however, a good deal of evidence to show that Edward inherited
the collecting proclivities of his father, and was encouraged in
this amiable failing by Eleanor. He spent very large sums of money
in buying gold and silver plate, jewellery, carvings and embroideries.
Records remain not only of his own possessions, but of the lavish way in
which he and the Queen presented such works of art to religious houses
which they visited from time to time, and in which they took special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>interest. An example may be found in the accounts of the Queen’s
executors, where we find that a certain Brother Nicholas received the
sum of £10 for bringing jewels, and, apparently, other works of art,
from Acre to England for the Queen’s service.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>In the year 1290 and for some time before, the King’s master mason
at Westminster was a certain Master Richard Crundale, or, as he was
usually called in the Rolls containing the accounts of Queen Eleanor’s
executors, “Magister Ricardus de Crundale, Cimentarius.” Richard
Crundale was the direct successor of such great architects and builders
as Master Henry of Westminster, Master John of Gloucester, and
Master Robert of Beverley, who had been successively the King’s
architects, and to whom we owe the beautiful designs and the excellent
workmanship of Westminster Abbey. Crundale succeeded Robert of
Beverley, and had apparently been in charge of the work at the Abbey
for about ten years at this date. To him the King entrusted the building
of the cross at Charing, and also the construction of the beautiful
tomb in the Abbey Church, but it can hardly be doubted that it is to him
we owe the suggestion of designs for many of the other crosses, and it is
at any rate clear that the influence of the Westminster School is shown
both in their planning and in the selection of the architects and builders
who carried out the work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The accounts of the executors show that, in addition to the work for
the cross at Charing and the tomb in the Abbey, the statues of the
Queen which found places in all the crosses, and much of the decorative
stone carving, were made at Westminster under the eye of Richard
Crundale.</p>

<p class='c008'>In association with Crundale, there were at work in Westminster two
sculptors (“Imaginatores”) of renown, namely—Alexander of Abingdon,
and William of Ireland; these were the men who carved the statues.
Ralph of Chichester carved much of the decorative stone work. The
painter who decorated the tombs had also a high reputation in his time—Master
Walter of Durham. Master William Torel, a citizen of
London and goldsmith, had the good fortune to be chosen to mould and
cast the metal effigies of the Queen, which found their places on the
tombs at Westminster and Lincoln. His work was carried out in
material of more durable character, and his reputation as an accomplished
craftsman in metal rests firmly on the evidence of one of the
most perfect remaining examples of mediæval art. Another worker in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>metal, Master Thomas de Leighton, has left evidence of his skill in the
fine iron grille over the Queen’s tomb. The executry accounts tell us
also of the men employed by Crundale to bring the stone and Purbeck
marble from Corfe, Caen, and other places, and the names of others
associated with the works at Westminster are still preserved.</p>

<p class='c008'>The actual cost of the erection of the Cross at Charing is difficult to
tell. The accounts show that large sums were received by Richard
Crundale, amounting to some £700, but this sum no doubt represents
work for other memorials to the Queen, and not alone for those at
Westminster. It is also evident that the executry accounts were not
complete, so that an exact calculation of the cost is no longer possible.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
Unfortunately Richard Crundale died before the completion of the
Queen’s memorials, and was succeeded in 1293 by Roger Crundale,
under whose care the work was completed.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r40'>40</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To obtain some idea of the cost of the memorials, money
at the end of the thirteenth century may be considered to have
possessed thirteen times its present purchasing value.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The cross in the City of London at the west end of Chepe was
entrusted to Michael of Canterbury, a member of the Westminster
School, and subsequently the successor of the Crundales as the King’s
master mason in Westminster. This distinguished architect was engaged
in rebuilding the Chapel of St. Stephen’s at Westminster while working
on the cross at Chepe. Of the exact plan of the “Cheapside” Cross
little or nothing is known, but there can be little doubt that it conformed
in essential details to the plan determined on by Richard Crundale. We
know, however, that Michael of Canterbury undertook the construction
of Chepe Cross for the sum of £300, and the executry accounts show
payments to the extent of £226 13s. 4d. This gives us the closest
indication we can now obtain of the actual money spent in building the
crosses. It is generally recognized that the cross at Charing was the
finest and most elaborate of the series, but Chepe Cross, situated as it
was in the City of London, must have also been a noble example of
artistic work; probably the crosses in country places were on less
magnificent a scale.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cross at Waltham was constructed by Roger Crundale and a
certain Dyminge de Legeri, sometimes called de Reyns. Roger Crundale
was obviously a member of the Westminster School, and there is little
doubt that he was Richard Crundale’s brother. Dyminge de Legeri
may have been a foreigner, but his work was held in high appreciation,
for he not only helped in the construction of Waltham Cross, but was
employed in making the sculptured tomb at Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The building of the five Midland Eleanor Crosses—namely, at St.
Albans, Dunstable, Woburn, Stony Stratford and Northampton—is of
special interest, inasmuch as the work was entrusted to what seems
to have been the mediæval representative of a firm of architects
and builders in Northampton. The most prominent member of the
firm was a certain Johannes de Bello, or de la Bataille, in whose
name most of the payments are made out, but with him was one
scarcely less important, namely, Simon de Pabeham (Pabenham).
These two builders were also of the Westminster School, and appear
later in connection with works at Westminster itself. At this time,
however, they were working at Northampton as their centre. Nearly
£400 was noted as being paid to John Battle, but we can form little
opinion as to how the money was distributed. The cross at Northampton,
a beautiful example of Battle’s handiwork, still exists.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We know nothing of the architects or builders of the crosses at
Geddington, Stamford, or Grantham. The cross at Geddington remains
the most perfectly preserved example of the whole series. This cross is
remarkable, as it shows a completely different plan from those already
mentioned. Indeed its scheme of construction differs to such an extent
from the others that it is not probable that Crundale had any part in its
design. It is also noteworthy that no mention is made of these
three crosses in the executry accounts. If arrangements for building
them had been made at Westminster, we should have had evidence of it
in the executry rolls. It is probable, therefore, that in the Geddington
Cross, the only one of the three remaining, we see the work of some
other master. The influence of the builders of Lincoln Cathedral may
have made itself felt so far as Geddington, on the border of John Battle’s
territory. It is, however, very tempting to make the suggestion that the
cross at Geddington—possibly also those, long since destroyed, at Stamford
and Grantham—owe their origin to foreign artists. Those places
we may regard as having been in the Queen’s own country. On her
marriage it is specially mentioned that she received in dowry important
possessions in Grantham, Stamford, Tickhill, and the Peak. At the time
of her death we know that there were Spaniards in her household, and it
may be that the very unusual and striking design of Geddington Cross
owes its origin to a Spanish rather than to an English artist.</p>

<p class='c008'>At Lincoln, the rebuilding of the Cathedral had given rise to a local
school of art, influenced no doubt by, but independent of, the greater
school at Westminster. The master builder of this school at the time
was Richard de Stowe, sometimes called “de Gaynisburgh,” evidently a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>man of local birth and training, whose tombstone is still to be seen in
the cloisters of Lincoln Minster. To him was entrusted the erection of
the cross at Lincoln, but some finer decorative work was done by the
Westminster artists. William of Ireland furnished the statues and the
ornaments so frequently mentioned in the accounts as the “virgæ, capita
et annuli,” and special mention is made of payments to him for their
carriage to Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c008'>The construction of the tomb over the remains of Eleanor in the
Cathedral was entrusted to Dyminge de Legeri, with whom was
especially associated Alexander of Abingdon. This tomb for long supported
a replica of Torel’s effigy of the Queen at Westminster made by
that artist’s own hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The monument constructed to contain the heart of the Queen in the
Church of the Black Friars in London, must have been elaborately
beautiful. Walter of Durham expended his utmost art in its decoration,
and in addition special effigies of the Queen were placed on this
monument, which were made by Alexander of Abingdon, Dyminge de
Legeri, and William of Suffolk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Richard Crundale’s design for the Memorial Cross consisted of a solid
pillar, surmounted by a cross, following in principle the more ancient
crosses existing throughout the land; but with his greater skill in
construction and more developed artistic feeling the simple column was
surrounded with new architectural features.</p>

<p class='c008'>The area on which the cross stood was covered with stone pavement,
on this pavement a smaller platform, attained by a varying number
of steps, was built, from this platform arose the cross proper. The
architectural decorations surrounding the column were arranged in three
stages. The first stage presented three, six, or eight faces, arranged in
panels; in these panels were carved shields, emblazoned with the Queen’s
heraldic bearings, giving the coats of England, Castile and Leon, and
Ponthieu.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a> The second stage consisted of a platform for displaying the
statues of the Queen, the number of statues corresponding to the faces
of the cross—three, four, or more, as the case might be. Protecting the
statues was arranged an elaborate system of “tabernacles,” giving to
the passer-by the impression of a shrine. The third stage showed the
continuation of the solid column, probably in most cases surmounted by
a cross. The whole of the monument was ornamented with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>decorations characteristic of Early English decorated architecture. The
work was done at the best period of this school, and shows how
beautifully the artistic ideas of the time could be utilised for monumental
purposes.</p>

<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Lincoln.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross at Lincoln was built by Richard de Stowe, who at the
time was the master mason in charge of the work at Lincoln Cathedral.
Stowe received sums on account of his work during the years 1291 to
1293 amounting to £106 13s. 4d.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of Stowe’s design for the cross we have no record, but the presumption
is that it agreed in its main features with the other crosses, for some
of the finer decorative work and statues were sent to the cross from
Westminster. They were entrusted to William of Ireland, the
“Imaginator.” The accounts of this sculptor are specially noted. He
received in all the sum of £23 6s. 8d. for making the statues of the
Queen, the “virgæ, capita et annuli,” and for their carriage from Westminster
to Lincoln. We know that he received the sum of five marks—£3
6s. 8d.—for each statue. The cross stood on Swine Green, opposite
the Gilbertine Priory of St. Catherine, where the Queen’s body rested.
The last traces of the cross at Lincoln have long since disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tomb in Lincoln Cathedral was erected by Dyminge de Legeri
and Alexander of Abingdon who was under the immediate influence of
Westminster. Note is made of their receiving £18 6s. 8d. on account
of their work at Lincoln, a sum, however, which includes a small amount
to Alexander of Abingdon on account of making statues for the tomb at
Blackfriars. Roger de Crundale was evidently associated with the
work, as he is mentioned as receiving £1 16s. 8d. for marble supplied and
work done at the tomb of the Queen. The most important feature of
the Queen’s tomb, however, was the metal effigy made by William Torel,
which was an exact replica of the effigy on the tomb in Westminster.
The tombs at Westminster and Lincoln were probably similar in design.
The Queen’s tomb occupied a position under the great east window of
the cathedral, but now no relic of it survives.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1901 a monument in memory of the Queen, copying the original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>tomb, was placed on the southern side of the retro-choir by the late
Mr. Joseph Ruston. Sufficient information was obtained from drawings
of the original monument by Dugdale and Bishop Sanderson, now in
the possession of the Earl of Winchilsea, to permit of this being done.
This monument, however, could not be placed in the original position on
the north side of the “Angel Choir” as the site had been used for a
recent interment, and the Bishop’s Chair had been erected close to the
site.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> No fragments of the original tomb were discovered when this

<p class='c019'>“Not far from hence upon the North side of the Town near unto York

stone about it, as the Arms of Castile Leon quartered, being the
paternal coat of the King of Spain, and divers other hatchments
belonging to that Crown, which envious Time hath so defaced, that only

<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Geddington.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross at Geddington has withstood the ravages of time and has
been disturbed less by restoration than the others. Its design differs
greatly from that of the other remaining crosses, but it is so elegant in
spite of its unusual structure, that it is very unfortunate that we have
now no knowledge of its builders. No mention is made of Geddington
Cross, nor of Stamford, nor Grantham in the Queen’s executry
accounts. These Rolls, however, are not extant later than the year
1294. It is possible, therefore, that these three crosses were built a
year or two later than the others.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The cross stands in the middle of the village, where the main road
from Stamford to Northampton turns in a southerly direction to pass
over the old bridge across the small river Ise. There is here a widening
of the road caused by the junction of a road from the east, allowing
of a clear space, so that the cross is well seen from all sides. The
cross itself rises from a platform led up to by a series of eight steps,
arranged in hexagonal form. It is exceptional in being triangular in
section. The first story consists of three faces, each face being divided
by firm mouldings into four panels. These panels show a beautiful
example of stone carving in various diaper designs. Even now the effect
is rich, but before the outlines had faded, the diaper work must have
shown great firmness and strength. The upper panels of the lower
story present the shields bearing alternately the arms of England, Castile
and Leon quarterly, and Ponthieu, as in the case of the other crosses.
The second story also gives the effect of a triangular outline, the angles
corresponding with the middle of each side of the lower story. At
each angle rises a beautifully moulded pillar which, with similar pillars
from the other sides, support the series of canopies sheltering the three
statues of the Queen. These tabernacles are richly ornamented in
the characteristic style of decoration of the period. The third story
continues the main column of the cross upwards, and consists of a
cluster of pillars ending in decorated finials, repeating the designs of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>tabernacle work below. The column may have been originally surmounted
by a cross. Fortunately no attempt has yet been made to
replace the terminal feature. The triangular design of the cross gives a
very curious effect when it is looked at from certain directions. It will
be evident that when seen from a line parallel to one of the faces of the
second story, the whole of the cross presents a lop-sided aspect. Its
symmetry of outline becomes obvious on changing the point of view a
little to one side or the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Geddington Cross, like the others, suffered not only by exposure to
the elements, but perhaps even more by neglect and wilful damage. It
is mentioned that in ancient times, during the rough sports which were
held on Easter Monday, it was the custom to catch squirrels in the
neighbouring woods and turn them loose in the neighbourhood of the
cross. The little animals naturally took refuge in its crevices and
corners, whereupon the mob attempted to destroy the squirrels by
stoning them, and many a decorated finial and beautiful piece of foliage
must have been shattered on those days.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the south side of the steps leading to the cross is a spring of
water evidently used from time immemorial by the inhabitants. It is
now covered in by a small square-headed stone cistern. This cross
fortunately escaped the ruin which befell so many of the other memorial
crosses during the Civil War. It was restored in 1868, and repairs
were judiciously carried out in 1890.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>The cross at Northampton is the only one remaining of the five built
by John Battle and his partners. It occupies a site on the east of the
main road leading south, at a distance of about a mile from the town,
in the parish of Hardingston. The road rises slightly as it leaves the
flat land of the Nene Valley, and on this little elevation the cross was
erected. It was the proximity of the religious house of Cluniac nuns
(S. Maria de Pratis), now Delapré Abbey, which determined the spot
where the funeral procession stopped for the night. This cross stands
quite in the open country, and its fine proportions can be easily seen.
Unfortunately it has suffered much, both at the hands of time, but
especially from the restorer, and much of the original decorative work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>has disappeared. Its strong, beautiful outlines give the observer a high
idea of John Battle’s skill as a designer.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The cross is situated on a platform surrounded on all sides by an
ascent of nine steps. From this the cross, which is of octagonal outline,
rises. The lowest story is supported by buttresses at the angles, and
the faces thus formed are divided into two panels by a perpendicular
moulding. Surmounting the panels is a series of decorated gables. The
panels show alternately shields with the arms of England, Castile and
Leon quarterly, and Ponthieu. In addition, every alternate face is
ornamented with an open book.</p>

<p class='c008'>The second story is arranged also to give an octagonal outline, but
consists really of the quadrilateral solid column of the cross, on each
face of which stands the statue of the Queen, about 6 ft. in height,
facing north, south, east and west. Attached to this solid column is a
series of eight open tabernacles, elaborately and beautifully decorated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above this tabernacle story rises the solid four-sided column of the
cross, panelled and adorned with pointed tabernacle work, reproducing
the designs of the story below. The column originally terminated, in
all probability, in a cross-shaped finial. This no longer exists, the feeble
effort to replace the terminal cross during the restoration of 1713 being
happily removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first restoration of the cross of which we have particulars was
in 1713. It was carried out very badly, and certainly in bad taste.
Further repairs were undertaken in 1762, during which the benefactions
of the restorers were duly and pompously notified on the cross itself.
Careful repairs were carried out in 1884, and now the care of the cross
is vested absolutely in the Northampton County Council. In spite of
the destruction due to early restorations, the Northampton cross remains
a remarkable tribute to the skill of the architects and builders of the
period, and a fine example of English decorated work.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is difficult to obtain an idea of the cost of the crosses erected by
Battle. The executry accounts give evidence of a sum of nearly £400
paid to Battle and his partners, but this money was on account of the
five Midland crosses. We know that the accounts are incomplete, so
that the amount spent was no doubt larger than this sum; possibly also
a larger amount may have been spent upon the cross in such an important
position as at Northampton than in certain other places.</p>

<p class='c008'>In addition to the money which passed into the hands of Battle,
considerable sums were paid to William of Ireland and Ralph of
Chichester, who were entrusted with the sculpture of the statues of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>the Queen, and the finer ornamental work represented by the constantly
recurring item, the “virgæ, capita et annuli.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The building of the cross involved another very important piece of
work at Northampton. The roadway from the town to the Queen’s
cross passes over the flat marshes of the River Nene. Robert Harrison
(Robertus filius Henrici) received £80 for the construction of a causeway
across the marshy land, and certain sums were also expended in laying
the pavement. The necessity for such a “rood-way” is obvious to
anyone who has visited the spot, and the building of the causeway
would have been regarded at the time as a work of piety.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Stony Stratford.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross at Stony Stratford was one of those built by John Battle
and his partners. Ralph of Chichester was the sculptor employed to
do the ornamental work. He is noted as supplying “virgis, capitibus
et annulis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Lipscomb, writing in 1847, says:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“The cross here was demolished about 1646, but an old inhabitant,
William Hartley, told Mr. Cole that he remembered part of it remaining at
the western extremity of the town.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Woburn.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross was erected by John Battle and his partners, Ralph of
Chichester being employed to make some of the ornamental carving.
The puzzling détour of the procession from Watling Street to Woburn
was no doubt due to the desire of the King to have the advantage of
the religious services of the important Cistercian Abbey at this place.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Dunstable.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross at Dunstable was built by Battle of Northampton and his
partners, part of the sculpture being supplied by Ralph of Chichester.
It stood in the main street of Dunstable, where Watling Street crosses
the Icknield Way. The Church and remains of the Augustinian Priory
of Dunstable are situated a very short distance to the east, along the
Icknield Way. Mention has already been made of the description given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>by the Dunstable annalist of the arrival of the funeral procession, and
the ceremony of consecration of the site where the “lofty cross” was
subsequently erected. The cross is said to have been demolished by
troops under the Earl of Essex, in 1643. Parts of the foundation of the
cross have been met with during recent alterations in the roadway.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>St. Albans.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross was erected in what became the Market Place of St. Albans
by John Battle and his partners, some of the sculpture being supplied
by Ralph of Chichester. The visit of the procession to St. Albans is
especially noteworthy on account of the record remaining of the elaborate
religious services in the Church of the great Benedictine Abbey
during the night the procession rested there. In 1596 the cross is
described as “verie stately.” There can be no doubt, however, that
already the cross had suffered much damage by the lapse of time, as
well as by neglect. At any rate, scant ceremony was shown to the cross
in later years. It is stated to have been partly destroyed by order of
Parliament in 1643; fragments, however, stood in the market place till
the year 1702. In 1703 an octagonal market house was built on its
site; in 1765 this became a pump house, and in 1872 the present
drinking fountain in the centre of St. Albans was built on the consecrated
site of the “verie stately cross.”</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Waltham.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross at Waltham was constructed by Dyminge de Legeri
(de Reyns) and Roger Crundale. Crundale was a near relative, probably
the brother, of Richard Crundale, the master mason at Westminster,
and was obviously in close touch with the Westminster School.
Dyminge de Legeri, of whom we have little knowledge—his name
suggests a foreign origin—must have been a builder of recognized skill.
It is possible that he may have been specially associated with Waltham
Abbey.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The cross occupies a position on the main road at Waltham, where
a side road branched off leading to the important Augustinian house of
Waltham Abbey. The platform from which the cross arose seems
originally to have had ten steps. As the result of restorations this
number has been diminished to four. From this platform the cross,
which is hexagonal in design, arises. Each side of the lower story is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>divided into two panels, which show alternately the shields charged with
the arms of England, Castile and Leon quarterly, and Ponthieu. The
panels are surmounted by pointed three-cusped arches supporting a
quatre-foil decoration, and finally a gable-like ornament. The whole
panel is richly decorated, the upper part with diaper work. The second
story, which is separated from the first by a perforated battlement,
consists of a series of open tabernacles in pairs, sheltering three statues
of the Queen. The tabernacles terminated in profusely decorated
triangular gables. The third story, still hexagonal in shape, is
ornamented with tabernacle work, reproducing the designs of the
story below. From this arose the shaft of the cross, which has
been replaced during a recent restoration. Considering the ruinous
state into which Waltham Cross had been allowed to pass in the
beginning of the eighteenth century, it is almost a wonder that so
much of the original structure still remains. The lowest story still
gives a good representation of the original work. The Queen’s
statues remain after having suffered many indignities. Most of the
rest of the cross gives evidence of restoration.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1720 Dr. Stukeley remarked on its ruinous state, and prevailed
upon the Society of Antiquaries to take steps for its preservation, and
Lord Monson surrounded and strengthened the base of the cross with
new brickwork in 1757. In early days the Four Swan Inn, at the
junction of the road from Waltham Abbey, was the only house of any
importance near, but other houses gradually arose. The cross and its
site apparently belonged to no one, so the houses crowded on the cross,
till at length they actually abutted on its eastern side, destroying much
of its beautiful work and even endangering the solidity of the whole
structure. The prints of the cross in the eighteenth century show the
ruinous condition into which it had fallen.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the beginning of last century a local committee undertook its
restoration, £1,200 being expended at this time. This work was
finished in 1834. In 1893 more complete restoration was carried out,
nearly £1,200 being again expended on the cross.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a> The Falcon Inn,
which had encroached on the cross so as actually to be in contact, was
set back, and now the roadway surrounds the cross on all sides, allowing
its proportions to be seen, and aiding in its preservation. It is interesting
to compare the sums expended on restoration with the amount
noted as being paid to the original builders. The sum of a little over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>£90 can be traced into the hands of Dyminge de Legeri and Roger de
Crundale. Alexander the Imaginator aided a little in its construction,
and a good deal of the stone, especially the Caen stone, so much in use
at the time, was conveyed directly from the works at Charing.</p>

</div>

</div>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Chepe.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross in the City of London stood at the west end of Cheapside,
opposite Wood Street. The construction of this cross was entrusted
entirely to a distinguished architect Michael of Canterbury, who at the
same time was engaged in building the Chapel of St. Stephen’s at
Westminster. There is unfortunately no relic of the original design.
In the Guildhall Museum, however, are two broken stone panels, which
formed almost certainly a portion of the Eleanor Cross in Chepe.
These panels show the characteristic heraldic shields emblazoned with
the arms of England and of Leon and Castile. Portions of ornamental
mouldings are also preserved on these panels. It is possible that these
may be relics of the work of Michael of Canterbury, but it is more
probable that they are of later date. In the case of Chepe Cross, we
may gain the best idea of the amount of money spent on individual
crosses. Michael of Canterbury evidently agreed to erect the cross for
£300, and the Queen’s executry accounts give evidence of his receiving
£226 13s. 4d.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the year 1441, the cross “being by length of time decayed,” John
Hatherley, Mayor of London, procured licence of King Henry VI to
“edifie the same in more beautifull manner for the honor of the citie.”
This restoration probably followed the main lines of the original
structure, and was very slow in progress.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 18.</span><br />The Cross at Waltham, from a photograph by the Author, 1908.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the course of time the citizens of London seem to have lost
interest in the cross and its significance, and it is only necessary to refer
to the pages of John Stow, published in 1603, to sympathize with this
worthy’s indignation at the desecration which the cross had suffered
even in his time. It had been partly restored on several occasions
subsequent to the time of John Hatherley, including various re-gildings
and re-burnishings in honour of various important royal functions, but
in the year 1581 “diuers Juries” of the citizens having considered that
it stood in the “highway to the let of carriages,” so much prejudice was
aroused that on the night of 21st June a band of roughs destroyed the
lowest images round the cross. These, however, were images totally
different from those originally on the cross, and included one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Virgin Mary. In the year 1595, according to Stow, this image “was
againe fastened and repaired, and the yeare next following a new misshapen
son born out of time all naked was laid in her arms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Later the cross was further desecrated by the addition of an alabaster
image of Diana, which served the noble purpose of a water conduit for
the benefit of the citizens. Attempts were made by certain members of
Queen Elizabeth’s court to bring home to the Mayor and citizens the
desecration of the cross which had been permitted. But shortly after
Christmas, 1600, “the image of Our Lady was again defaced by plucking
off her crown and almost her head, taking from her her naked child
and stabbing her in the breast, &amp;c.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

Kingsford, 1908.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The cross by this time could only have presented a remote
resemblance to the original work. The new statues which found a
resting place on it had no reference to its original purpose. During the
religious and political turmoils which followed, the crosses both at Chepe
and Charing formed the subject of numerous political lampoons, which
are interesting as giving some idea of the frenzy of destruction which
possessed the extreme political sects. It can hardly, therefore, have
been considered a matter of regret when the last scene of all was enacted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cross, mutilated and desecrated beyond recognition, was completely
destroyed on 2nd May, 1643. The Parliament deputed a certain
Robert Harlowe to do this work, who went with a troop of horse and
two companies of foot, and carried it out completely. “At the fall of
the top cross drums beat, trumpets blew, and multitudes of caps were
thrown into the air, and a great shout of people with joy”; so runs a
contemporary account.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c008'>The history of the cross in Chepe is important as giving an indication
of the gradual process of decay which seriously damaged the crosses,
long before the desecrating hands of political fanatics mutilated and
finally destroyed the remaining fragments.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Charing.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>The cross at Charing was the work of Richard de Crundale. He
was responsible for the design of this cross, but his design no doubt
influenced the ideas of the other builders, for we know that much of the
finer work of the other crosses was executed under his observation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Most of the statues of the Queen were carved near Charing, and
many of the ornaments so frequently referred to as the “virgæ, capita
et annuli,” were also made by the Westminster artists. The cross
was built approximately on the plot of ground now occupied by the
statue of Charles I, facing the great thoroughfare now known as
“Charing Cross.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Richard Crundale himself died in 1293, and Roger Crundale came
from Waltham to carry on his work. Nearly £700 can be traced as
being paid to the Crundales for their work at Charing, but this sum
obviously includes work done and materials supplied for other crosses.
The finer materials used in the construction of the crosses, such as Caen
stone, Purbeck stone and marble, seem to have been distributed to the
other crosses by way of Charing. Considerable additional sums of
money are mentioned as being paid to merchants of stone, such as
William Canon, Robert Blunt, and others who brought the stone from
Corfe, and Henry Mauger who supplied stone from Caen. Alexander of
Abingdon, the “Imaginator,” carved the statues of the Queen for
Charing; William of Ireland, also working at Charing, carved the
statues of the Queen which found their way to the crosses built by John
Battle and Richard Stowe; while Ralph of Chichester carved much of
the fine stonework for the crosses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unfortunately no adequate idea can now be obtained of Charing
Cross. It is admitted, however, to have been the finest of the series;
but it must have been subject to the same vicissitudes as its neighbour
in Chepe, and the sketches which exist, purporting to be Charing Cross,
can only have been obtained from the mutilated structure which survived
to the middle of the seventeenth century. The drawing in the
Crowle Collection of the British Museum, which has been reproduced
by Wilkinson, is one of these. The suggestion of the cross in van
den Wyngaerde’s view of London gives, perhaps, a better idea of its
probable appearance.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> John Norden’s account is that of an eye
witness, and tells of its condition about the year 1590. He speaks
of it as “an old weather-beaten monument erected about 1290 by
Edward I. Amongst all the crosses which the King caused to be
built ... Charing Cross was most stately, though now defaced by
antiquity.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The cross in the forecourt of the South Eastern Railway station at
Charing Cross was erected from the designs of the late Mr. Edward
Middleton Barry in 1864-1865, and is the result of his own desire to
have the opportunity of reproducing the Eleanor memorial at Charing.
Mr. Barry was a learned as well as a distinguished architect, and visited
Northampton and Waltham Crosses many times before deciding on the
design of the monument he proposed to erect. It is well worthy of
careful study as expressing the ideas formed by a conscientious artist and
student of the appearance of the old cross; especially it shows the desire
to give the idea of the original builders, and to avoid the travesties of
construction which have not infrequently been erected purporting to be
after the fashion of an Eleanor Cross. Unhappily the motive which
renders the crosses at Geddington, Northampton and Waltham so
entirely appropriate, and which adds so much to their interest, cannot be
transferred to the new site.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='label'><a href='#r55'>55</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The author is indebted for information respecting Mr. Barry’s cross to

</div>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Blackfriars, London.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>It was a custom of the time for devout persons to desire that the
heart should be removed after death, and taken to some peculiarly holy
place. Queen Eleanor had taken special interest in the community
of the Black Friars, and especially in the Church which they had just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>built in London. By her own special request her heart was to be
taken to this church, and Edward took special pains that a tomb should
be erected worthy of containing this relic.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is little knowledge of the design for this monument. A certain
John le Convers seems to have been a clerk dealing with the payments,
while Adam, a well-known goldsmith of the time, and much in the confidence
of the King and Queen, was asked to make an angel to support the
casket containing the heart. In addition to this figure, which was of
metal and gilt as were Torel’s great effigies, statues ornamented the
tomb. These were no doubt of the same design as those erected in other
places. They were the work of Alexander the “Imaginator” and
Dyminge de Legeri, and very probably of the same character as those
at Lincoln. Alexander also constructed certain iron work around this
monument. William de Suffolk made three small images in metal for
the Blackfriars tomb.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most interesting features of the monument were the
paintings by Walter of Durham. This artist received the large sum of
£46 13s. 4d., according to the Queen’s accounts, for his work at
Blackfriars. Part of the stonework, consisting of a <i>crista</i>,
perhaps an ornamented stone canopy, was built by William de Hoo.</p>

<p class='c008'>All traces of the tomb disappeared at the time of the dissolution of
the monasteries. The responsibility for the final act of destruction
seems to rest on the shoulders of the same Sir Thomas Cawarden into
whose clutches there also fell the Church and possessions of St. Mary
Roncevall.</p>
<h3 class='c002'><span class='sc'>Westminster.</span></h3>

<p class='c018'>On the tomb at Westminster a special amount of care was devoted
by the artists and workmen employed by Edward. The design was that
of a large chest formed by slabs of Purbeck marble, in which was placed
the body, and the top of the chest was arranged to support the bronze-gilt
effigy of the Queen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tomb itself seems to have been designed by Richard Crundale,
and the work was completed by himself and his brother Roger. Under
their supervision the stone chest was ornamented with the characteristic
decorated carving of the period, and with the shields bearing the arms
which are so prominent on all the Eleanor memorials. Walter of
Durham was employed to decorate the tomb with paintings, while
Thomas de Leighton, a skilful worker in metal, made the iron grille
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>protecting the effigy. The perishable part of the stonework is unfortunately
fast disappearing, and faint shadows only of the paintings may be

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The chief glory, however, of the tomb still remains, namely, the
great bronze effigy of the Queen, the work of William Torel, goldsmith
and citizen of London. Torel designed and cast not only the effigy at
Westminster, but the replica which reposed on the tomb at Lincoln.
Records remain of enormous quantities of wax and of metal supplied to
Torel for this purpose. The effigies appear to have been cast in one
mould, and the work must have been difficult to execute. After their
completion the bronze castings were gilt, and special reference is made to
the purchase of gold florins for this purpose. These coins appear to have
come from abroad, and were obtained from the merchants of “Luka”
and others. The figure shown is of so noble a design that the wish
arises that it might be regarded as a portrait of the Queen. The
evidence, however, seems to be complete that the effigy represents
Torel’s ideal of a queen’s statue; nevertheless it remains to this day
perhaps the most remarkable example of a statue in metal dating from
the early “decorated” period of English art (fig. 12). Special financial
provision was made for the purpose of the religious services at Queen
Eleanor’s tomb, including gifts of land and money to the Abbey, the
proper employment of which was subsequently the source of much discussion
in the chapter.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The anniversary service in memory of the Queen took place on
November 29, the eve of St. Andrew’s Day, and was continued up to
the time of the dissolution of the Benedictine community.</p>

<p class='c008'>To obtain an idea of the appearance of this monument, it must be
recollected that not only was the tomb itself formed of finely decorated
stonework, but was surrounded with elaborate paintings, while the great
gilt effigy of the Queen was studded with the jewellery and enamels
which Edward gathered from the East and abroad. These he lavished
with the utmost profusion in decorating this, perhaps the principal,
monument to his wife.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
